2019-12-12,1,367,Taipei,Interview,Man,Oko Davaasuren,Community Leader,https://www.linkedin.com/in/okodavaasuren/,Techstars,Startup Incubator,https://www.techstars.com/,"Before: I was working for the APEC in Communities Development in Asia Now: I’m doing quite the same job with Techstars, with a business development scope of application.","What we want to do in local communities is to coach local influencers to hand over the lead of the ecosystem to them. In this regard, we just launched a new website named Taiwan Startup Community that we will promote before leaving the management to the local members of the startup ecosystem of Taiwan.","Techstars provide a systematic approach to build ecosystems of startups. Which means endeavor support on all entrepreneurial initiative. Besides of what we are actually driving an extensive research on social graphs to understand the dynamics between our ecosystems stakeholders, in order to find a way to better engage everyone. This data analysis should be published to the community in mid-January.","Techstars Taipei is support by the MOST — Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, TTA — Taiwan Tech Arena, and Qualcomm.
We put a priority on building a strong private sector support because of their level of expertise, their financial capacities and power of influence on the whole ecosystem. For startups and entrepreneurs, the final goal is always to satisfy the needs of a customer. Corporate companies have huge experience and valuable knowledges on their markets and clients needs, so their support in startup ecosystems is central.","I assume startup ecosystems can have an influence among city transformations, especially when the Startup Accelerator is specialized in the Smart-City thematic, like Techstars Amsterdam, but our main goal is not to transform cities. We dedicate our work to develop entrepreneurship.","By my work I have met a lot of people coming from poor family conditions. The social empowerment by the startup movement whom which citizens and youth in particular can benefit is priceless. All the skills they are learning by startup experience is huge: story telling, business development, self-fulfillment, global education, ambition, career building … Entrepreneurship is a real way of life achievement and empowerment for many people.
Some generations before had the music movements, like rock bands, to learn by experiment and build a living. Art and fashion were ways to do the same : it structured and empowered whole generations of youth. Nowadays, startup movement and digital entrepreneurship is the worldwide movement to help the young people of our generation who want to keep their heads above water, learn things and make a society.",,,,,,,
2019-12-13,2,368,Taipei,Interview,Man,Edward Lin,Senior Industry Analyst,,MIC — Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute,Private Research,https://mic.iii.org.tw/english/,"I have been graduated in the Taipei University of Technology. I’m working as researcher and market analyst for 11 years. At the beginning of my career, I was working on Smart-Phones and Smart-Devices. In 2013, Taiwan government proposed a Smart-City project and I started to re-orient my research in this direction. The “Smart Urban-Rural Project” of the Ministry of the Economic Affairs of Taiwan planned to invest 6 Billion NTD in this field and had to identify their needs: Smart-Transportation, Smart-Lightening in Streets (we notably implement a system of 1-by-1 identification of street lights, to improve maintenance by less ground recognition of the public workers)",,,"We recognize ourselves as an official governmental think tank: the MIC — Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute depends on the III — Institute for Information Industry. We work as a non-profit private sector research by teams of 7, each of us specialized in a topic: energy, agriculture, retail, health, transportation… and publish books and reports of our results of research.
We receive public grants to help the government in strategical decision-making among the technology of information field. We also receive some private founds from our consulting branch. Actually 70% to 80% of our founding comes from the government of Taiwan, but private industries supports us to have an access to collaborative construction of national rules on their markets.",,,"Yes, I would say not only the people: it is hard to make it understandable to public servants too. Many local governments don’t know a lot neither. Before 2013 no one knew Smart-City concept. Now Taipei City is working on it for quite a long time and have much more experience to share. In practice, the national government budgets are rather dedicated to the capital city of Taiwan (Taipei City).","Building a Smart-city and decision-making in urban planning asks for a certain level of expertise. The average people have a good knowledge of what they need in everyday life but do not really think about how new technologies work and how it can help them. But government knows how new technologies can improve public services in hospitals, universities, factories… and they do it. As for experts, this is our job to chose which technology is good for society and make them understand how to use it the simplest way. This expert gap is the same for IoT and 5G.
What is the most important to maintain good relationships between experts, government and citizens is transparency. Even if most of citizens do not look for it, it is important that the one who want to understand better the choices we did on technology for society can access all the information he needs. Our roadmap of the decisions planned for the next two years are fully transparent and available to everyone.","This is the main difference between democracies and central powers. In Taiwan, like in most of European countries, we have to face every day critics of the government by the people. Decision-making and the deployment of new technologies are necessarily slow down by these social movements but there too I think that transparency of governance is the best answer.","We consult entrepreneurs and local governments of Taiwanese cities by interviews, to answer the best to the consultation missions given to us by the state.
We also organize an internal annual event where all members and employees propose ideas to improve our organization. A lot of organizational innovation is collected every year on this event. Our employees work by groups to propose ideas by presentation to the whole organization. We use the auditorium of the National Taiwan University to pool everyone at the same place (200 employees at the MIC and more than 2000 in the 6 institutes of the whole III) It is also a good way for internship students to train make good public and a way for the company to identify the best potential recruit.
We do not really need for an online open platform of consultation: we have an informational website for extern and an efficient intern communication inside the institute: anyone can contact anyone by direct email. In the III they also have an intern platform to refer issues to the managers.","Our web managers collect useful information on the key-words researched by the users of our websites (ex. 5G…) It helps us to identify what’s the main interest of the public on our research and gives a guideline to our reports to publish. In practice, our research reports are often used by students, researchers, and entrepreneurs.",,
2019-12-17,3,369,Taipei,Interview,Man,Chen-Yu Lee,Director,,Smart-Taipei,Public Think Tank,https://smartcity.taipei/,"I majored in computer science, and PhD in Artificial Intelligence. I have a technical background of education. I started my career as consultant for the government. I spent 10 years working for the III — Institute for Information Industry, then took a break of some months to manage a small enterprise and joined the TCG six years ago. Smart-Taipei is an independent branch of the Department of Information Technology of Taipei City Government.
In my career I spent a lot of time helping universities and schools, by national e-learning project (national program to help industries and schools or universities) to understand what is Smart-Learning and promote it. I focus on Smart-City for 6 years now, because I think it’s crucial to help the government (both national and locals) to have a better understanding of what’s the best things to do in terms of society. Smart-City is a concept far different from pure technology. The consequences of choices among the people and the quality of living are big. There are 22 major cities in Taiwan. Kinman is one of the smallest but also one of the richest because of its industry. They were the first of Taiwan to invest in Smart-City equipment. Not a big success to be honest because it was the beginning of the model and they didn’t really know what to do in the lack of concrete feedback on the concept. They took the first direction of the Smart-City developers which consisted in deploying a lot of tech on infrastructures, and it didn’t work so well than expected.
Later we started to think about a new definition of the Smart-City, in collaboration with Amsterdam City, and enlarge our vision to a wider problematic than a technology-only “How to build a new system of city?”",,,We started to work as a team of 15 and we are now 20 in my team. We dedicate our mission to help Taipei City and citizens to adapt to the new technologies. We continuously work with the Mayor of Taipei for more than 4 years and have a very good collaboration with him because we share a similar vision of the City.,,,"The term Smart-City is vague: it includes a little bit of everything so it is even more complex. Globally the population and the public services do not have the same idea of what a Smart-City is, and this difference in definition creates problems. We spend our time to deal with the people to make them understand what is a Smart-City.
Deploying Smart-Solutions is not enough to obtain a Smart-City: it takes a lot of time to deal with the whole system. In practice, a lot of new technology fail. From our point of view, if the city government invest in a technology, it MUST be successful. We can not tolerate a risk of uncertainty at the large scale of public services. Sometimes we prefer to chose oldest solutions, because they have more maturity and there is no risk of investment loss. Our mission at Smart-Taipei is to suggest the mayor a technology vision which contains no risk of failure.","Yes indeed, we help the industrials to interact with the citizens by physical events. For example, we recently organized a promotional event for a Smart-Scooter service in Taipei (note from the author: Gogoro)
In Taipei, the city council is very powerful and efficient as a political tool. Most of the citizens prefer to answer it that to the industrials, so the people use the city council to forward issues, concerns, etc. rather than taking direct contact with private companies. Regarding the technology topic and Smart-City, we have been forwarded for a strong concern by the population on data privacy. As for public reaction, strict rules have been edited by the government and all the industrials who collect data on their users have to respect it.",,"Our first year we spent a lot of time to interact with the citizens, by different means. But in Asia the citizens do not implicate too much in politics. The people do not really interest in how it the things are done, but rather in the final result and they want expect from the governments that what they do produces results. We started Smart-Taipei with an online open platform which didn’t worked at all. So we chose to organize many live events and offer gifts to the people to implicate them. It’s an old method which have produces much more results.","As I said earlier, we do not use online platform anymore: our first experience didn’t worked and it is not our primary mission. But some other departments of the TCG use their own, they build their own digital engagement tools like online voting.
At Smart-Taipei our main concern actually is: how to make the citizens feel that Smart-Solutions are interesting for them and they should use it ? We notably recently had to use services from a French company specialized in scanning public buildings to give an expertise on refurbishment. It have been very useful and relevant to take time and use public budget for this mission, that we used not only on the public buildings but also public bridges. This is not a secret but no one really knows because no one people really care about it. However it was a very important mission from the public sector to secure the population and their common patrimony.
For this kind of decision, we mostly need the support of the mayor rather than the support of the population: it has had an important cost and most of the people would have probably criticized the amount of money spent in it. In practice, the population is not necessarily of a great help on technical subjects, even the very important ones. We can’t lean on the population wishes only, even when the mission is about their direct interest or security. As for my concern, the Smart-City model can’t focus on the citizens only, but on all stakeholders to take balanced decisions which respects the needs of everyone. So we ARE this collaborative platform for stakeholder engagement.","6. So which are the main trends you have been able to identify by this way of citizen consultation ? It turns out that the population is interested by waste collection, urban parks and leisure areas. They interested in road traffic fluidity and parking spaces available, but they are not interested in the system. From that point we realized that our first mission were not to make the people think about “Smart-City”. We are not a public service properly speaking and our role is not to communicate directly with citizens. Indeed we collect information out of the people and we help the department to find the best solutions adapted to people’s needs.
The ideal model of collaborative society, with engaged citizens in decision-making and the use of bottom-up collective intelligence as political process do not work in Taipei City.
But we still need for new innovative solutions. For that we turn to the industry. We take direct contact with them to understand how the provate market can deliver concrete creativity on issues identified by the government and the people. Public services do not want to have a direct contact with the industrials to not be suspected for illegal interest, lobby or corruption. So our office serve as a bridge between the industry and the government: we help the public sector to access the information from private sector. ;

In 2016, I started to work for the Bureau Français de Taipei with a mission on innovation. My role was to identify interesting technologies and make a connection with French enterprises. In the other direction, I also had to help the French companies to foothold and cooperate with Taiwanese tech. The French Office of Taipei receive very diverse missions, as for me I had among other missions to assure the labeling of the French Community of Startups in Taiwan. What happened some month after my arrival.","In 2014 a brand is created by communities of startups in 14 French cities, including Paris. The next year, 2015, has been the year of an expand of the brand on major foreign cities, international innovative and financial places where French startups started to gather (London, …) In 2016 the French Tech started to label big hubs worldwide (Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong-Kong…)
In France and abroad, local communities started to use the brand to get more visibility on their startups, even without being labeled. At the contrary, some labeled communities where not necessarily very active on their territory, so the French Tech went into a re-structuration of its network and re-centered on its primary missions: recruit talents, help raising founds, open the access to markets abroad. This restructuration has been finalized at the beginning of 2019, and come out in 38 communities in France and 48 communities abroad, in a direct relationship with the French Minister of Economy. The main part of the staff is based in Station F (biggest startup incubator in Paris). We are not a French expat meeting point: we have about 50% of Taiwanese in the French Tech Taiwan. Since the beginning of the community we have had 3 Taiwanese in the board. Our resources are Taiwanese as well, like our incubators and investors. We work in Taiwan in a direct relationship with the Minister of the Economy, the Minister of Science and Technology and with local medias oriented innovation and entrepreneurship like Business Next, Tech Orange …","In FT Taiwan, we are notably implicated in the APAC (Asian-Pacific) communities by a network coming from French Tech Singapore to structure the activities of the French Tech in the region.
FT Taiwan is 1 board of 5 to 12 people, essentially entrepreneurs and some initiated to startups. 4 work daily on the project Taiwan, 1 is in charge of the night activities and events, and the others implicate time by time. We have approximately 15 people implicated every year on this or that project.",,"Very lightly: transforming the city is not part of our role. We are more concerned by linking the French startups with the city decision-makers.
The living-lab of Taipei makes the Smart-City experimentation much more accessible but we didn’t had to accompany a startup dedicated to urban innovation so far. Except one company which proposes a floating solar panel system for lakes and paddy fields. They implement themselves in Taiwan rural areas rather than in Cities. We didn’t had any Civic-Tech actor neither, so not any direct relationship with g0v movement, but the French Office in Taipei makes much more in terms of civic-tech, they notably received this year the visit of the Liberty Living Lab (Parisian Incubator of Civic Technologies).
We have some punctual exchanges with the TCG, we always answer to the call for event organization, which is very regular and effective in Taipei. LIve events are numerous and successful. As for our concern, we organize events to mix Taiwanese and French entrepreneurs.",,,,,,,"6. What interest the Taiwanese interested in France ? They mostly interest in business opportunities in France they do not know. Historically the Taiwanese have much relationship with Japan and China, also with the USA. The Taiwanese are interested in Europe: they know Germany by their long-time branding strategy on “German Quality”, they know Netherlands notably by the sea freight Kaohsiung — Rotterdam, and they know England by the English language. So French is not the first European country they know in Taiwan and we work on giving a better visibility among French market here.
Furthermore, the Netherlands invest a lot in Green Technology in Taiwan, they are the first European Investor in the country. France invest few actually so in return it do not collect Taiwanese investments neither. We try to change that and open the door between France and Taiwan.",
2020-02-06,5,371,Tel Aviv,Interview,Man,Eyal Yaniv,"Director, Chairman",linkedin.com/in/eyal-yaniv,Bar-Ilan University,Academic Research,https://www.linkedin.com/school/bar-ilan-university/,"The Bar Ilan Center for Smart-Cities has been created by professor Eyal Yaniv, PhD in Business Administration and Mastered in Social Science, now Chairman at the Business School of Bar Ilan University, with experience in the web industry. Ran Goldstein, is Mastered in public policy, and graduate in Business Administration. Passing a double Master Degree in a primary discipline and in Business Administration is very common and makes sense for the whole ecosystem of Israel : they do not practice a research without looking for the best and shortest way to value it concretely. So, they are all at the best strategical position to know first what happens in their own industry.","In some place of the world, we can visit amazing hubs and innovation center but nothing comes out. They do not have an old generation to push the new generation forward. In Israel the first generation of tech startups from the early 90s, help the newbies: they give ideas, advice and coaching. They know how to really help because they have already processed the same way. And this double competence in research and starting business is the regular mindset from the beginning of Israel. We had a country to build and strengthen to exists toward its neighborhood and regarding the world diplomacy, and an economy to create from scratch. So the Israeli have always been part of a same final goal to achieve. The professors have the practical background of the market. They are both mentors and academic professors. This is very specific in the world to have this passing of power between generations, except in the silicon valley, where it is kind of the same.","We organize an annual event to bring all the municipalities, the companies which we partner with. We exchange ideas, propose networking and joint research about what they could do together. We also organize time to time gatherings. Here we can host events on specific topics like “education” for example. In one month, an open event to the students and the neighbors will be host around an episode of the Silicon Valley TV series, and after the watching, we will engage a debate with the public to get their feedback on how to implement a similar plan in the university campus. We open these events by web conferences locally, and plan to open it to our partners in Europe as soon as possible. Because we are an academic actor, we need to find a solution that will respect the copyrights, the security of the connection, the firewall of the university etc.","In Bar-Ilan University Center for Smart-Cities, we are an academic institution gathering municipalities, industrial companies and startups. We are free to implement solutions on the campus to proof-test the products developed by our partners but even this living lab do not lead enough to direct opportunities to deploy tested solutions in the city. The relationships with government are not so fluent: a lot of decisions can’t be taken by the municipality but depends on the national state. The buses and public transportation in Tel Aviv for example, depends on the ministry of transportation of Israel. To caricature, the mayor can’t move a bus station by himself. This centralization of decision-making creates problems and delay in deploying effective solutions. Then, the tech companies and IT industrials are very good, but so they take to many power of influence on the electives, the government and the municipal council. It creates an overthrow of the hierarchy in the direction of a few private interests.",,,,"At the beginning of modern Israel, it was desert everywhere, 70% of the land is considered as arid or hyper-arid. So the first tech companies of Israel come from the agricultural sector. Then a large part of Smart-City companies started in state security (army, surveillance tech, firewalls, etc. ) So now their innovation follows the clients needs which are the State or the biggest Municipalities and the Army. Another characteristic is that we have 250 cities in Israel which is too much for the small population of citizens. And the scale of the cities are very different, so it is very hard to find a unique model of Smart-City to generalize : the major smart models do not make sense for small infrastructures. These small cities gather in clusters of municipalities but so it deletes public servants and makes it difficult to take decisions on investment in the tech field. And most of them are too small to have someone dedicated to the tech issue in local government, so nobody urge them to move ahead. As a side consequence, even if 95% of Israeli people have an access to internet it can be too slow in some parts of the country.",,,,"What kind of management do you apply and how is it different from the majority of tech hubs ? The way of management is different and comes from the army. It’s a “Go, Go, Go !” mindset which tolerates to solve the problem along the way which is the best for an army and also for the startups. It’s OK to fail, and start again, we are looking for the best way to hit a goal, sometimes we try something, if it do not produce direct results, it is not a problem. What is important is to know why it failed and what kind of experience can be reached out of the fail. Then, both the team building and the innovation in itself starts in the military context. The most famous unit to deal with cyber-things is the unit 8200, subordinate to the military intelligence directorate. But the Israeli Army way of management is not the same than regular armies, often characterized by hierarchical relationships and the subordination of lower ranges. The Israeli army is based on the maximal empowerment of the soldiers and informal relationships between the chief and the others. Everyone have the right to tell directly what he thinks, feels, and can suggest another plan to achieve a mission. We do not look the grade but the efficiency and the competences of each soldier ; What else can you tell about the particular mindset of Israeli Startups Ecosystem ? A downside of the reward on the competence and the career progress to the merit,is that some generals in the army do not want to receive any advice and think they do know everything. A bad habits we can find in the business too. It creates problems of blockage in the free deployment of solutions. The combination with centrality of decision-making and this legitimate self-confidence on some successful people sometimes create deadlock situations hard to deal with. Even harder to negociate since Israel is a political island with conflictual neighboring. Isolated from Europe : no direct mainland road connection, an only maritime connection with Italy, with good relationships with the governments of Egypt and Jordan, but where the populations do not like us. Too many challengers in Lebanon and civil war problems in Syria ; ",
2020-02-11,6,372,Tel Aviv,Interview,Woman,Hemdat Sagi,Head of Strategy & Business Development,https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemdat-sagi-6296411a/,Konnect-Volkswagen Group Innovation Hub Tel Aviv,Startup Incubator,https://www.linkedin.com/company/konnectvw/,"I have been hired by the Volkswagen group two years ago to set up this community. Before that I spent 5 years in Berlin serving as a commercial attaché at the embassy of Israel to help Israeli companies to do business in Germany. My first mission was first for for the brand Audi, then I’ve been asked by the whole group to grow an innovative hub in Israel.","We launched this hub in 2018, we are now 8 people in Israel defined as an open innovation hub (6000 in the whole group). We find startups in Israel to incubate, following the challenges of the brands (Porsche, Audi, Volkswagen), we evaluate their maturity, their potential for growth and the compatibility with our intern goals. We make the link between corporate companies and startup innovation, to see if it is possible to bring them to a next level. Since now we have accompanied 24 projects. Our interest for car innovation goes from drivers health, outside sensors, inside the cabin innovation, cameras, lighter automation, etc…","We organize events to present speakers from the group to our local network. Startups, Venture Capitalists are the public, with other hubs and accelerators. There are a lot of challengers who propose incubation services and investments in the best startup solutions, but Israeli first ressource is the people and the tech innovation, so the innovation strategist of the city always finds the way to bring more and more new actors in the ecosystem and in works so far. This situation of challenge between the hubs is good for the startups who can select the partners and the corporate they want to work for/with. So the best strategy we are applying so far is to keep in touch with everyone, something that makes sense with the Israeli ecosystem characteristics where everyone knows everyone and want to pull up the whole economy of the country.","We are 100% supported by our corporate group. Our mission for them is to host people from the group who bring their own ideas and improve it with the innovation team here. We are the local place of the group to acquire this innovation hub mindset. Failure is hard in Germany, but it is necessary to succeed transformation. So we host and train our own employees at the Israeli mindset. So we do not need any subsidies from the local or national government but we keep in touch with them to launch our mobility projects. For example we are at the point to launch a robot taxi project in Tel Aviv, so we need state and municipality authorization, but also a dedicated infrastructure. A specific road to test the cars will be opened soon. The main negotiation with the government comes from the fact that they want the data. We do not have relationships with the academics, we follow them from far away. I personally think that the startups are most innovative and advanced in research on their markets. Then of course we need to follow the Venture Capitalists to reach them in financing our innovations. We do not have any contact with the civil society since we do not do any B2C sale. Except for surveying on potential users which are not done by the hub itself but rather by the startups incubated.",,,,"We are super tech hub for mobility innovation but downside in the street the public transportation do not work so well. This is a contradiction that may affect the inhabitants. This is the mindset of Israel, things are not very structured and framed but it encourage people to a lot of creativity.",,,,,
2020-02-17,7,373,Tel Aviv,Interview,Woman,Liora Shechter,CIO at Tel Aviv Municipality,https://www.linkedin.com/in/liora-shechter-b04281133/,Tel Aviv Municipality,Government (Local),https://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/en/Pages/HomePage.aspx,"I followed a primary education in computer science and 2nd Master’s degree in Business Administration (like most of academics in Israel). My career started in IDF — Israel Defense Forces, then I joined the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality as Chief Information Officer in 2011.","As a slogan it would be “transform TLV to become a smarter city”. The primary goal is to focus on implementing different kind of services for the residents of the municipality. The secondary one would be to develop tools to better manage the municipality in a more efficient and optimized way. The third one is to inject innovation into the municipality itself, and improving the collaboration with the startup ecosystem is the way to do it. So we develop practical ways for a continuous implementation of innovation in the public services.","The digitalization of municipal services was not enough and we wanted to move on a more personal approach. As for every good web platform, every user have to find a personalized service. So we created a members club : Digitel, is a free Resident’s card, that give the residents an access to a lot of personalized benefits, depending on the personal info users declare. Depending your tastes for culture, activities, if you are married, with childrens or not, the municipality brings residents valuable services, data and specialized information. To be efficient, e-services must be delivered at the right time for the right person. For example, if you have a new born baby, the municipality will send you personal kindergarten services, activities for kids, last minute tickets for shows… The municipality is offering something fun and free that is relevant for the resident. They appreciate it. From the perspective of the resident, the municipality gives discounts that brings a close and good relationship between citizen and local government. For example, the municipality is giving some free yoga classes, sport and activities in the municipality hall rooftop, people can access beach volley courts and street workout in every beach and parks, navigate with small boats on the river… So it is a way to have fun and experience positive relationship with the municipality. We have developed an app to reserve a seat on the beach at the best price, with possibility to pay online and have a receipt instantly. This digital experience spread all over the city: the municipality engage to fight the high cost of living and bring the resident the best experience and benefit of cultural offer. Thanks to this Resident Card, 70% of people are engaged in a direct digital relationship with the municipality, an unprecedented opportunity for us to reach them directly. The engagement of the communities and citizens in running the municipality is done by public participation events, both physical and virtual. It’s not only voting because it do not give opinions. It is a combination about open and guided decisions, depending on what is asked. What should be implemented in the education, in the community center etc. In practice, our citizen consultation is not about an infrastructure project because people do not really feel concerned by architecture of the buildings or the design of public spaces, public engagement is more about how to impact the daily life of the citizens. Because of the digital power, we are able to cut the population by neighborhood and target directly the people. We do not ask people from neighborhood X to decide for inhabitants from neighborhood Y. And we apply this targetted participation in every department of the city : it’s a guide-lined philosophy or our public services.","We already implemented 80 to 90 % of the public services digitally. This seams to be the first step for building a digital relationship. Now we understand how to make the process better, how to be proactive towards our public service mission. So it is not only about digital implementation, it is also how you do it and how you implement it. For the moment, Parking, kindergarten registration, school registration… all services are digitalized. ; We do have collaborations with the government (national) but not high relationship. The best supporters come from the local government (municipality) managers. The IT department has 450 employees to develop more 90% of the digital tools in house. The municipality collects and owns all the data from citizens, private companies and public services departments and so we are able to do integration to all kind of data. The idea is to really collect Datas and bring it to personalized activities. So we built an online real-time map with different layers accessible to different public departments. Depending the needs of info for your mission, you can have a direct access by this map to what is happening right now in the city. This dashboard is filled by intern services information (data on infrastructure) but the citizen can load information too: by the possibility to take a picture of any public space and report some issue directly to the municipality. So we do have a layer on this map of the reports by inhabitants but we also have sensors, cameras, contractors cars and our own cars (public services) displayed on the map. We integrate all these Datas on the map and divide the Datasets to the different services : we have developed specific applications depending on the professions. You do not see an operational global dashboard like that in other kind of smart cities. We meet with a lot of cities worldwide to share experience and knowledge. We do not try to sell our model, we just share experience.
","The public transportation actually is quite bad, and the bike lanes are not continuous neither. About the transportation, indeed, Tel Aviv was not built for massive transportation. So we do no have any underground metro system not tramway or enough space to build dedicated bus lanes. Tel Aviv is a fairly new city but we still have to carry 1 million people who come every morning to work and leave on the evening. Public transportation is a high concern of the municipality but still is the responsibility of the state Government. So we are in a transition period for the moment. A light train is in construction but the sites block a lot of streets, and it will get worth until it will be ready to circulate in 2 or 3 years. About the bikes, it’s the same : the project is quite new (5 years old) and we are actually building more and more roads. Car sharing and bike sharing systems are the competences of the municipality. So we work with the government to find a solution on the use of public roads and the integration of multiple modes of transportation. It will take 3 or 4 years to close all the gaps. But the underlying policy is to give the pedestrian a first priority. The single proprietary car users will have less and less comfortable ways to drive in the center city because we plan to avoid it as much as possible in the future.",,,,,,,"Tel Aviv is the capital city of the Startup Nation, how do you tackle the problem of the high attractiveness of your city for worldwide innovative brands and investments ? Indeed the municipality of Tel Aviv is using this concept as a Startup City as well. So we provide a lot of services to support local startups and the Smart-City deployment. We also have selected 31 startups to become Tel Aviv Tech Ambassadors. Specific services are developed for startups: tailored datasets, open datas, one-to-one talk with a municipality expert… If they have a prototype or product to test, they can try it on the better site for 6 months in real conditions. We also have opened working sites for startups, among others City Zone, The Library, one for children in Sarona and The Platform, which is oriented to the immigration community. We also organize hackathons and lot of meetups. The Smart-City center in Tel Aviv University: CityZone is also a publishing city challenges and invite startups who want to tackle them. They enter in a one year program driven with facilities to implement live solutions in the city. A sort of Living Lab but very practical. All of them aims to bring a direct solution to an identified problem, as fast as possible. So we can say that the municipality have a good collaboration with startups. The municipality is absolutely not set aside of the deal between private companies and inhabitants. The local government in Tel Aviv developed not only open data but open architecture of the information around the municipality. The first customers are the apps from the banks and wallets (FinTech). And we take the risk to let an outsider to reach inside the data of the municipality, not only to access it but also fill in the Data Storage. The biggest challenge to make this startup city a reality is that the time zones and languages are usually not the same between startups and big organizations. At the municipality we are giving an equal chance to everyone on the market to develop a solution for an issue.",
2020-02-24,8,374,Tel Aviv,Interview,Woman,Elisabeth Dray,Real Estate Agent,https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisabeth-dray-5a461372/,Ec Nadlan Tel Aviv,SME,,"I’m French, living in Tel Aviv for 25 years. When I moved here, Tel Aviv was already criticized for being a liberal enclave in a much more conservative Israel and Middle-East region. I came here because I felt very free to live like I wanted. The Israeli love the quiet, the nature, the chill.",,,,"The tramway should have a super effect to unblock the city mobility. The first line should be open in 1 or 2 years. A part of the population, the youngest probably, should catch the opportunity to live in the suburbs of Tel Aviv and access more affordable housings. It will regulate the demand and so the prices of rents and sales in the center city real estate. The 2002 UNESCO label on the Bauhaus architecture of Tel Aviv and the work of the Department for the Conservation of the History of Tel Aviv are leading to a beautification of Rothschild boulevard without a deep transformation of its population, density, ambient and landscape. This attachment to its own culture was lacking in Israel, outside of Jerusalem. Both the Bauhaus architecture and Yafo district are valued now. This grand found for the refurbishment of historical patrimony is accessible for the public and the private owners. As for lifestyle, I sometimes miss the Tel Aviv I knew some years ago. The city ambient really changed about 5 years ago. A lot of oldest local inhabitants are not comfortable anymore. I feel that it moves too fast and not in the good direction. The dogs for example occupy a space more and more significant. The LGBT movement too bothers me. It has been radicalized lastly and do not seems to be emancipatory anymore. I feel sidelined from the city by too many social movements which impinge on the harmony of the city lifestyle. Too many people adopt a cleaving attitude under the guise of personal liberty. I’m wondering where this will end.",,,,,,,"How would you explain the real estate market of Tel Aviv and the city transformations those last two decades ?  20 years ago, Tel Aviv center was very small. Then you had two residential neighborhoods in the periphery: Ramat Aviv, quiet and clean, rather inhabited by the upper middle class, and Tzahala, more popular, hosting the former militaries. Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai is mayor for 22 years now. He succeeded in changing the image of the city, provoking an important flow of foreign investors, notably French, to buy holiday accommodations on the seaside. The front of the beach were absolutely left behind before that time, there were no children, no family, no young people. Tel Aviv center and beaches were inhabited by elderly with limited financial resources. With the flow of investments from abroad, the mayor invested a lot of money and effort to refurbish and boost the center of Tel Aviv, to attract the youngest generations of Tel Aviv population. He opened restaurants, nightclubs, refurbished the old docks of Tel Aviv Port Namal. By contrast with the residential periphery where there is nothing to do at night, the center of Tel Aviv became the only place to go out and have fun at night and Tel Aviv gained this reputation of “City that never sleeps”. Once this leisure revival, the cultural offer of the city has gone from strength to strength and the mayor started to allow building rights on Rothschild Boulevard to build luxury real estate and attract the wealth of the periphery. Indeed once the children had left the house, the upper class of the population living in periphery realized they could enjoy better the proximity with the cultural offer of the center town. These two key maneuvers highly increased the prices of real estate properties in the whole town. The inflation started 20 years ago, and the peak have been reached 4 years ago. Nowadays the price of a tower building on Rothschild Boulevard is about 30 to 35.000 USD by square meter. The economy is very strong and apart from the big war with Lebanon, the prices never get down, even during the regular wars. The economy and the market of Tel Aviv are not influenced by the politics, it is on a parallel lane. We are having major elections running at this moment, but people seems to be very disconnected from the politics. (note from the author: the elections mentioned in the interview happened indeed days after and have registered a turnover of 70 %) . ; 
What’s the profile of the inhabitants now, and the actual trends on the market ?  The cost of living increased, everyone complains but the restaurants and the bars are full. The young people living in the tech and the bank sector have high revenues and they spend money. The Israeli consume and travel. The average salary in Tel Aviv is about 10.000 shekel (2.865 USD) with a large standard deviation, from the minimum salary at 5.500 shekel (1.575 USD) to the Tech and Bank salaries around 20 to 25.000 shekel (5.733 to 7.166 USD). As for an idea, a family of couple with two kids needs 30.000 shekel per month ( 8.600 USD)and a 4-room flats costs from 8.000 shekel per months ( 2.293 USD). The birthrate is very high in Israel (about 3.2 children by family) and this trend is being reinforced : the Jewish loves family and children things. There are more and more buildings for the elderly people too, which are not retirement homes. The silver economy develops itself a lot, also in terms of cultural offers and services. And the young people are a lot to live in the center too, even if it costs a lot to live here. Flat sharing is a basic for students and young professionals. Co-living is the new trend: two real estate developers are actually opening whole buildings dedicated to this demand . ; 
What’s your professional point of view on Tel Aviv reat estate market today ?  Prices started to be regulated by the ministry of finance elected 4 years ago. Rather than create lower taxes in peripheral zones to boost, the State have increased the impositions in the center. Taxes, right to acquire, tax rate on the gain of the sale, as been increased in the center. The psychological effect has been to frozen the market. The sales has been slowed, and that have had a hard impact on the real estate agencies which contributes to the whole economy of Tel Aviv. The investors stopped to invest, the real estate developers stopped their projects while the center city was already lacking 15.000 housing units. The scarcity of rent offers contributes to the continuing inflation. The crucial part is to find a land. The land is owned by private actors or the State. The KKL — Jewish national found is the biggest public land owner but do not sell lands to build easily. Furthermore the Public lands are sold by Public tender so the price is usually the highest as possible, and the private owners use to negotiate the sale with different challengers, so it keeps high too. The main demand of housing is in the center, where a nude land is almost impossible to find, so developers buy an old building, demolish it and build a new one. 12 to 18 months are the common delay to obtain a building permission in Tel Aviv, so the real estate developer has to carry a project for about 5 years, which has high costs. I think that the municipality is kind of opposed to this private to market initiative to increase the offer of housing and so decrease the access price. It always wanted to make a wealthy city in tel Aviv. The sun have been hiden in some streets since the building of all the scyscrapers, it has contribute to change the ambiance of the city. ; ",

I came a first time in Tel Aviv three years ago, but it has been hard for me at that time to adapt the cultural gap between Russia and Israel. I continued traveling, two years ago I created All Things Urban from London, a career platform for urban professionals working on city challenges worldwide. This startup experience and the envy to settle down brought me back to Tel Aviv, with a better mindset. The city is full of opportunities and I finally better appreciate this Israeli culture: there is always someone to talk to, to engage in projects to help, it makes a lot of sense when you want to launch a new enterprise.","I am starting SFERA, an urban innovation center based in Tel Aviv, operating on the intersection of urbanism, design, science and tech to facilitate and co-develop innovative human-centered solutions enhancing urban well-being. The first step would be to organize in april 2020 Biourbanism, a international conference in Tel Aviv gathering innovators of diverse fields — urbanists, biologists, architects, programmers and designers — to discuss how we can build better cities using knowledge from the natural ecosystems around us. Creating a dialog between researchers, businesses and policy-makers on a local and global scale, bringing together like-minded professionals from different disciplines, has always nurished my passion for urban innovation. With SFERA, I target to enhance urban innovation focused on well-being globally. Facilitate international knowledge exchange is the best way to give something back from what I have received along my international traveling experience. And I would like to help to place Tel Aviv on the global urbanism map.","We both communicate, participate and organize international and local events.

Then I graduated in PPE — Philosophy, Politics and Economics in Tel Aviv University. It trains people to take part in Public Sector, by giving them economic tools to reshape policies. I was particularly interested in urban planning and developing better policies for better cities. My first experiences in this field make me feel that it was missing of tech in public sector. So I joined insights.us, both a startup and a consulting company from Jerusalem to disrupt public participation. They developed a platform to facilitate open discussions in civil society. Using widely open questions, not closed questions like survey studies, to get natural feedback from the citizens, and algorithms to analyse the feedback with natural language processing. We had contracts in USA, Canada, UK, Israel, we had offices in Berlin to work with Germany and Austria. It was a good run, leading big consultation on big cities, but public sector move very slowly and pays very few. At a moment, the company have had to make a financial choice and stop the platform development to focus on consultancy contracts. I left the company, same as other colleagues. I have been contacted by Tel Aviv municipality which I worked with at insights, and they proposed me to be the director of The Library.","The Library is an urban innovation center managed by the Community Department of the Municipality of Tel Aviv. We are considered as a youth center, but we host startups at early stage which try to improve life in the city. We do not call ourselves Smart-City because we do not want to be associated with infrastructure innovation only. What we are achieving in The library is more about facilitating communities and bringing neighborhoods together, supporting education to technology. We look for an impact on anything that could make the city better. We are inspired by the model of a City As A Service and try to implement it in Tel Aviv Municipality. We provide our incubated startups diverse services such as mentorship, workshops, and meetings with experts and/or inhabitants. And we also orient the startups to help them find what can be really interesting for the city and the inhabitants.",,"As a public service, we are paid and supported by the municipality. We create facilities to connect the people. We provide access to data owned by the city, we help the startups to prioritize their needs to give them the right data at the right moment and we assist them in the use of raw data. We help them to create a pilot project, to test their products in real-city situations. Commonly, we try to make the city of Tel Aviv less expensive, by supporting a less consumer-based society… ","As for my experience, I wanted to transform the public sector, to make it better for people and more “Techy”. This is exactly what I am doing with The Library. I work in collaboration with CityZone, Department of Communication, and The Platform, Tel Aviv Global. We are the three main actors of the IT innovation on the city, each of us depending on a different city department. All of our operating system is a sort of big consultancy of the citizens. They are a network of innovation places working all together for the city. By challenging us and exchanging together, we are concretely achieving the transverse innovation out of the municipal department silos.",,,"Public participation and widely democratic processes will have to evolve in collaborative decision-making. Using web tools seems to be the most relevant way to do it, but no good solution has been found yet to do it at a large scale. Even if we know the need to bring the technology into democracy, the civic-tech do not bring valuable insights so far. Blockchain, AI, Machine learning are very promising but for the moment the best way to achieve citizen consultation is by analog processes such roundtables, surveys, workshops with inhabitants… It is time consuming and can’t be scaled up because it needs a personal presence of an expert or a public servant or an animator of debate, but nothing really work so good for the moment and we have to continue to practice a little bit of everything to find the best way to do it. ZenCity and Insights are the biggest actors working in that field in Israel. Obviously, tech is a part of their solution but not the main part.",,,,,
2020-02-27,11,377,Tel Aviv,Interview,Woman,Shana Krakowski,Director,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shana-krakowski-9a842317/,The Platform Tel Aviv,Startup Incubator,https://www.facebook.com/ThePlatform.TLV/,"I graduated in Public Policy and Social Work. My previous experience was in Non-Governmental Organization, where we were essentially helping the most destitute populations by providing them micro-financing services and business training. The reason why I took this mission for the municipality, as managing director of The Platform is because of the neighborhood we are settled in. This is the poorest neighborhood of the city, with a lot of poverty, marginalized people and migrants populations. So the neighbors here are more concerned about inequality and social issues.","As a Municipal center for entrepreneurship and innovation, The Platform is part of this whole ecosystem, both of this poor neighborhood and of the municipality. So what we are doing here is to try to use the startups as a solution to solve social issues. I am a direct connector between the disadvantaged people and the decision-makers of the city : each time an entrepreneurial initiative is built in the neighborhood, I connect it to the city. To achieve 5 success a year, we need 100 lectures and events involving 500 participants. From a first event attended, some participants will join classes, the most motivated will enter an incubation phase and at the end a few are really ready for a startup success. We have around 30.000 people living in the neighbor, about 300 are connected to The Platform. Not everyone want to become an entrepreneur. Most of the people just want to find a paid job and the education we are providing at The Platform help them a lot to upskill.","The municipality started a program, two years ago, called “being active in the city” for locals who want to get more involved. 20 people from each area (the city is split in North, Center-East, Center-West, South-East and South-West) benefited for 10 weeks to meet once a week with different public servants of different department of the municipality. They had group conversations and training on how-to propose projects, develop an idea and market it. I was teaching in one of those classes. Anytime some startup want to talk about municipality investments and budgeting a purpose of innovation, he can meet directly the Chief Information Officer who owns the budget for IT. The hardest step is to implicate the inhabitants and give them the envy to work with us. We communicate on Social Networks: Facebook , Whatsapp, Instagram. Finding the key people in the communities, which have the potential to bring their friends to meet us is a big goal. We call the ambassadors. Basically, after each program or each course, we have new ambassadors in the neighborhood. We sometimes hire part-time people who have local connections. Everyone who works here in The Platform lives in the neighborhood.","Our main supporter is the municipality. We are very connected to the Community Department, created 3 to 4 years ago, to create more direct contacts between the city managers and the residents. The Israeli people really appreciate this sense of community. Each area of Tel Aviv has its own staff, responsible for the fluent communication between inhabitants and public servants, so each community has its direct point of contact with the municipality. Working out of the silos is very inherent in Israeli culture which is a lot about relationships and less about hierachies and organizations. Startups trial in Israel means to meet one person, who connects you with another and another.",,,"There is a lot of engagement and openness of the government and between the people. But at the end of the day, there is still a gap of efficiency. Informal attitude to get direct contact with the decision makers or people in charge is very efficient, but at the end, it is necessarily a question of politics which are more concerned about this or that issue.",,,"Some platforms can help work easier, but the platform is not the issue. The issue is your mindset and how you work. Technology is only an expression of your attitude. Furthermore, the people who might be engaged by the online platform may not be the good persons to incubate. The real need is more about having smart data : adata base of insights, on who is doing what and who needs what would be very useful. The city centralize the data on inhabitants, but even as a public servant, it is not so easy, in practice, to access it. They are divided in different departments, with not the same rights of access. The data of Digitel for example are a lot about the interest of the residents, but do not talk about the real pains. It do not talk about racism, the cost of life, etc. There is not one place to get the data I would need the most and I am not even sure that the right questions I would need are asked by the people who collect the data.",,"Do you look the other startup initiative for migrants out of Tel Aviv ? Yes I look at it time to time, especially in Berlin. But I personally interest the most in empowering the people and giving them tools that will help their all life. My mission is more education-concerned. Entrepreneurship is very risky and basically we focus more on educating marginalized people to give them the tools to integrate the tech society of Tel Aviv. We usually help them to define the challenges to solve, to help them to know what would be useful to do for the municipality. At the same time, they shape their product or service offer in order to hit the municipality as their first client. We play the role of municipal startup incubation. ; 
So, did you try to collect your own datasets? I tried but not systematically. I did it with surveys, oriented on my goals. I would need more time to do it or someone dedicated to this. Or indeed a platform that could help to organize the data in order to fit better my needs. If there was a way in the daily life that we could organize the insights out of our work, it would be very useful. The small talks and relationships are the best way to know things informally, but if you do not put it down somewhere it creates a gap in the method.",
2020-03-03,12,378,Tel Aviv,Interview,Man,Nimrod Goldzweig,Civil Service,,SaronaHub Tel Aviv,Public Service,,"I’m 20 years old, after High School, instead of military service, I chose to do a sort of civil service 1 year or 2 years. I heard about this specific place by a friend who has been accepted in the center, so I tried as well. I’m more centered on technology, she is more centered on coordination. Civil service is not paid, but regarded as volunteering. We receive a place in a shared public flat with other peoples who do the same. We are 7 young people of the same age. Everything is paid (water, electricity, internet, etc. ) and we receive 800 shekel a month which is not enough to live but we still get support from the parents to start. A few words about Sarona: We had about 200 members who come here regularly, at least 2 times a month. Some can come twice a week but they are not always regulars, it come by phase. We are OK with this, we do not oblige anyone. 40 to 50 projects has been accompanied widely. ","SaronaHub is about empowering young people. The whole name is Sarona Municipal Teens and Youth Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology. The age of the public is grade so middle-school and high -school so from 11 to 18 years old. They come by themselves mainly and sometimes are oriented by the school. They have heard about us by internet, social media and word to mouth. We also have some cooperation programs with the schools. In particular we promote an Entrepreneurial Excellence Program in partnership with the Education Department of Tel Aviv which recommend our center. SaronaHub depends on the Department of Youth and Teens which is under the Community Department.  In a wide range, professional projects come out of here. More are social projects and initiatives that people want to implement. For example, a high impact project from last year has been to create football teams for girls in elementary schools. It opened in 2 different schools last year and has led to a tournament. This year, 30 feminine football groups opened in the schools of the city. It’s a big success. We are also hosting a Composting Restaurant Program : the team is working with local restaurants and the municipality to use the compost for the gardens of Tel Aviv. They already have physical space from the municipality and some restaurants but it is not so, easy to move the trash from one place to another. A teen came here to study marketing and design and now he have a small service company with contractors. He did connections and branched out in this space.","The most effective right now has been social medias : Instagram in particular (we receive and answer direct messages), secondarily Facebook and our own website, and the word to mouth works as well. We also go to schools at the beginning of the year to present ourselves, the hub and invite the kids to come. By time to time we also organize kind of parties on our thematic. Some days ago we had 150 standing persons. the usual route for a young who come here : we basically offer the open space to work, it’s completely free, and open on weekdays from 3 to 8 pm. They just come, without registering or asking anyone. They can come alone, with friends, to work on a project or just study their homework. We do not offer support on studies by the way. We propose content and advice on entrepreneurship and technologies. We organize events and meetings on these topics, depending on the demand from the users in the space. We provide workshops animation, content diffusion, and professional courses on different topics : coding, entrepreneurship, design, digital marketing, industrial design, financial education, cyber-security. The number 1 reason for a young to stop coming here is the army, usually we they start the army they do not have time or interest to pursue what they were doing here. And before the army they start to prepare the high-school diploma, so they are also very busy at this time. Another common reason is a lost of interest, not specifically for us, but teens explore a lot of areas, and sometimes, they want to create a startup one year, and next year they prefer to create a music band rather. So we try to lead the projects by community, like this if someone stops, the project can continue with the ones who still want to engage. Theoretically, their success could be a reason to scale up and take their own offices too.","We make a bridge in between kids and the industry. Most of the contents of the meetups and workshops are for adults, so when some young from the Hub are very successful in their project, we bring them to tours in Google, Microsoft, Facebook, these companies are present in Tel Aviv, so we show this world to the kids. They also benefit for a mentorship if they need a specific help in a particular field. ","The city will open a similar hub in the southern part of the city to reach out the poorest class kids and empower the communities of these districts. The whole concept is evolving on more creative and makers spaces. More about game and social and giving them tools and education training. It is gonna be another team in the Hub but we work with them to share experience and help manage it. We offer help to say how to start. No compete with them but try to be complementary. SaronaHub itself think about growing because sometimes it can be very crowded : the working capacity is 56 and for event we can host 150 standing people. But we do not want to come to this day where we will have to say some kids they can’t enter because we’re full. We would like more projects to come out of the space. Even if we do not take any fees or money, neither ask the kids to promote SaronaHub, for personal satisfaction, we would like to attract more people and help them in success. And we would like to attract kids widely, we do not want to be reserved for the kids talented in tech, genius at coding or with parents working at Google etc. We want all the kids to feel welcome to join and learn about tech and startups.",,,,,"Actually we do not, it is kind of messy with a lot of google sheets, but I am working on a graphic database platform website : Airtable, a no-code solution. We plan to implement it with tablets at the entrance, for the kids to enter their personal information, both connected to their profile and to the data center to assist them better.",,,

Then I worked for a company named Digital, that became Compaq and later HP. I was managing all the computer system of the Technion and then the data-basis of the minister of people, designed 30 years ago. In 2000 it start talking of mobility, I became CIO of a company building mobile solutions, one of the 3 major telecom companies in Israel. 7 years ago, established my company Elternet.co.il, dealing innovation on three major verticals : smart manufacturing, smart health and smart city. We are working for municipalities, government, ministries. Smart-City is a largely adapted concept, each authority implementing it take it to a different direction. At the beginning, smart city was a very wide term, there were no specific declaration of what it was. For example, in Israel we have three different frame tools to measure the cities, the three give different results. As result, a city can be considered as smart for one frame of analyse and not smart for another. Cities who want to get smarter would benefit better from a good level of expertise to advice them in the best directions to take depending on their unique context.","We are working for municipalities, government, ministries.

Some of them do not understand why it is needed to make the service digital. They do not know how to integrate public services with bank apps to ease payments for examples and they do not get the interest of the young population. So the minister of digital is now proposing a program to educated the public servants in the municipality. Considering the academic sector, it is hard to make the effective connection between their research and living experiences in the city. They do not evolve on the same agenda and speed, so I guess finally the academics do not have time to spend in implementing final user solutions in the city and do not really care about. As for my part, I am implementing a new way of thinking, called “best of grid”. It’s a process to help the municipalities to be free enough from corporate companies, which usually try to have long-term monopolistic contracts on the infrastructures. So I help the municipality to build the IT infrastructure by working with private companies, but keeping decision-maker about the use of the infrastructure and the data it produce. It’s a new typology of thinking which shows the municipality the way to take the best of the grid. Usually a municipality do not have a lot of money and so the technical level in the municipality is very low. So we are making the smart city concept very simple for the average public servant to use it the best.",,,,"It depends on how do you define the Smart-City as well. And this definition is not constant, it is always changing : there are different versions of smart city. The last one we speak the most about is centered on the citizen indeed, but it depends on the definition you give to citizenship too. Are you considered as a Citizen if you are born here? If you lives here? for how long ? If I rent a flat for some days or weeks or months in a city, am I considered as a citizen? And if I am already citizen of another city or country ? What happens if I have different addresses in different places at the same time ? Can I be considered as citizens in different places at the same time ? This questions led to the same usual reflection: which test, or proof of engagement, do I have to pass to be considered as a local citizen ? Then there is another reality: people like to say what they think, but sometimes, the municipality listens too much the people. We had a very bad example recently: one street was totally reconstructed, instead of 15 buildings of 20 flats, they built 15 new buildings, each of 3 times more. So from 300 houses you have now 1200 houses on the same perimeter. The most problematic issue now is parking: the municipality asked the people of the area what they wanted the most in the area. The answers was very clear : people asked for parking, a lot of parking, more parking, etc. However, the municipality didn’t had the budget or the technical solution to build it, or maybe it was just not what they wanted to do from this public spaces, and they finally didn’t built the parking. All the inhabitants are now very disappointed to have participate to a program that is finally not chosen. It would have been better not to ask their participation.",,,,,

The way we help collect crowd intelligence actually is more about shaping how the city managers make their work in relationship with the communities of people. By doing so, Insights try to bring two main values: good insights about how to improve the way to collect the outcomes, and giving Tel Aviv a feeling of shared value. For the next steps of our development, We are moving ahead on two tech directions: a pilot for Whats’App in order to collect participation by this way, and we also look for improving the way to learn from project to projects. We always try to make the consultation better from one city to another. We look for a better and better ability to analyse the data collected.","First you have to define what you want as outcome from the people and then you can bring the community to give this outcome. Consultation is not about proposing a choice between plan A or plan B, but you already know the one you want to implement, and you consult to manage the objections. I’m looking for a way to let the people decide by wisdom, on large decisions like education, urban planning, etc. For example, the Dov Hoz community center of Tel Aviv was not destined to be a community center for the neighborhood, it was a public property, non defined. We had the mission from the municipality to make it as a center for the surrounding inhabitants, so we started to multiply the contacts with the people, to make them consciously understand that they are a community of people living in the same area of the city, and learn from them what would be their needs to create and maintain this sense of community in the neighborhood. We wrote this how-to bill in our blog https://www.insights.us/case-studies/how-to-design-strategy-for-community-center","We are a private company, and we do not want to be held by investors, at least at the beginning. We did a lot of strategic projects for government and cities, so the public sector are our major supporters, but as customers, not by grants. We develop our platform by ourselves. In 2018 we understood that we could shut down the consulting unit and focus 100% on the tech development. We use to collaborate with companies which do the research and academic work and to promote our tools and method, to find new customers, we participate to conferences, we propose our platform. We go to conferences, to propose our product.","Our platform is not a communication tool, nor only a tool to prepare elections, it rather solve a change of mores in the way to do politics with citizens, with the aim to be more transparent and accessible. As from our point of view, this change of mores in the way to practice politics is much more regularly made by woman mayors. They propose a new way, more open, more collaborative, to do improve city governance. We work for 10 years, and the change needs time, especially in the culture of crowd and in public sector. The city managers still needs more time to understand that the citizens can help in managing the city, not just by stopping the process at the end when all decisions are already taken but do not make consensus. When the mayor understand it starts to be interesting.",,,,,"We are an engagement platform ourselves. Our business model is based on licences: the city have the right of access and a hand on organizing its own consultation by our platform. It can be about a thematic field (transport, education, environment…) or geographic area, neighborhood, city… And we help them to ask the right questions and find the right people to reach out. Also to close the consultation to avoid deception from the people who participated. We also propose an option for a workshop to train administrative employees but the platform is very intuitive so we usually do an on-the-job training by accompanying them in the implementation. Our platform do not work like a survey with open or close questions. On the main page, you have a sort of news feed, where each citizen can look what the others already said or comment. They can interact one with each other, highlight the most interesting answers. This is how we reach new ideas that makes sense, when multiple people highlighted it. Then we can take direct contact with the people, to remind them what they liked, confirm with them what they said. And we can aggregate the different messages, ideas, we make connections between each participants and the best highlights. The participant is asked to confirm by yes or no if it makes sense to cluster him with this or that consensus idea.",,"Do you thing one civic-tech tool like yours could covered the whole world ? I do not think so, our business model is not like Facebook or other B2C app. As a B2B, the scale is slow, there is a place for competition, and the market of consultation is different from one place to another in the world. We start to look at the private business customers : we recently started a consultation for a transportation company. We are the unique suppliers for this kind of service here in Israel. We have challengers, of course, but not about the tech, the competition is more about catching the client.",
2020-03-12,15,381,Tel Aviv,Interview,Man,Jeremie Hoffmann,Head of Conservation Department of Tel Aviv Municipality,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-jeremie-hoffmann-a881827b/,Tel Aviv Municipality,Public Service,,"I live in Tel Aviv since I’m 4 years old. After 5 years at the military service in IT, I studied history of architecture at the University Paris 1 Sorbonne and passed a doctoral degree with a thesis on the history of Tel Aviv City. At that time, I felt the need to build an external point of view on ourselves as Israelis. Now I’m the director of the Conservation Department of Tel Aviv Municipality, so my field is very specifically the patrimony of the city.","In my thesis, I insisted on the fact that it is feasible to collect information by informal means: I’m using books for children and movies to detect the representation of Tel Aviv city in the popular culture. The themes on which we lean the story telling of a city or a subject can be very interesting and say a lot. These wide tools are very new for the historians. I can see a parallel with social networks, which are a new way to access information on the people, on the city, on a subject of interest. We actually struggle hard to access information about how the people maintain or keep their patrimony. First, this culture of the material conservation is not very Jewish : the Jewish culture is a lot about the written memories, the Book, and a culture of oral transmission, but far from the building heritage. This can be explained because of the exile at the core of Judaism. Because the people move, travel, they didn’t created an habit to maintain the building. Secondly, the Synagogue in the architecture is not valued like a church would be for example. The aesthetic of the Holy places in Judaism are considered as Anti-Religious, somehow. Thirdly, the property is not a Jewish cultural element, because it is linked to the agriculture and the sedentary life-style, so a farmer will conserve the property of a house to pass on its family. In medieval architecture in France and in small villages especially, the relationship between the church and the village houses is almost sacred. In Judaism, the houses are not built around the synagogue. This traditional cultural trait of Judaism changes at the establishment of the State of Israel. It becomes the first moment in the Jewish history where we create a relationship with the territory. The first step was to build, and then the deep reflections on the idea of patrimony emerge in the 90's.","Roughly, there is the Liebling House — White City Center, a new institution to create links between the population and the architectural and cultural heritage. We widely create links by education, research, artistic exchanges, exhibitions, events, etc. We create systems where the people will learn about the values of the city, the elements, the histories and legends. All the schools of the Municipality are engaged in this program: we are creating a generation conscious about the patrimony heritage. The next generation will have the tools to engage more in the conservation. It is a long-term project, somehow old-school because I think that for life-long changes, education is more efficient than an app which can influence the behavior of course but for some years only. As for Research, we try to have more information on the civil aspect of the patrimony : the trees, the parks, the public spaces, the history of architecture. We anchor these information on the centralized map of the municipality, to make these layers it accessible at a wider scale to the whole inhabitants. I published a book on the Brutalist Architecture of Israel, published by the municipality. It is a sort of repository of all the buildings of this style, with the most information collected on each building. I creates a databasis, physical, to ease the exchange between the inhabitants and the administration. People can understand better my work, and contact me to know more or ask me to talk about it in conference etc. This book is available in all the libraries, it is 100% scientific, historic and neutral. This is not a public communication influenced by marketing or political goals on the population. I try to develop the idea that each public institutions, should have their own R&D centers, like the corporate companies have. In practice, the public sector have a lot of data about the city but do not know how to use it at all.",,"My thesis prove that a descriptive element of a city (Tel Aviv White City, Tel Aviv the Non-stop city… ) comes sometime from inside (an administrative work) sometime from the outside (influences outside of work : travel, culture, articles in magasines, meeting interesting people…). Moreover, inside the administrative machinery itself, there are moments of openness or closeness in regard to foreign influences. In the municipality, even if Israeli use the Tech a lot, they do not read English a lot, so the foreign influence is not very common. Furthermore, the Israeli society is closed historically because of its building inside an unfriendly environment. On the capacity to unify the population, the Hebrew language makes a lot. The language is designed for short sentences, very directs, oriented on efficiency. But so to deal with complex issues, it can be limited. The Hebrew we speak nowadays is based on the Biblical one, but it is new by the way. Influenced by a war context and the seek for survival as priority number one. Now we are not anymore in this survival context, but the language is still influenced by it. We are trying to evolve progressively by a research center.",,,,,,,"What would be the next steps for the conservation department ? We are now at the pass on between two generations: an old-school one who work on plans by reaching people directly, and a new one which works mainly with data and computational analyses. This gap is not about age but rather about the tools used. (cf. my article on phenomenology) I’m now looking at the open-source software Arches Project from the Columbia university, founded by Getty Conservation Institute, the biggest resource for history of architecture. The software allows crowd-sourced contribution to the repertory of patrimonial architecture in the cities, now extended to histories and legend about a place in the city, about songs, peoples’ habbits etc. I start working on this software in Tel Aviv, we are now at the adaptation of it for our public, for wider questions than only the historical neighborhoods. Indeed, we have 52 neighborhoods in Tel Aviv but a lot of them are empty in the regard of emblematic architecture. I do not want to give them an identity in the old fashioned way, which means sending some expert to look at which nice house or corner of the street we could use to make them iconic. I would like the people of the neighborhoods to do it by themselves, by sharing histories of their life in the area. I’m also looking at a planning simulation tool which could acknowledge the people on the effect of this or that choice in terms of urban planning. It would help them be conscious about the fact of the city, the society issues, and the secondary effects of their ideas on the life of the others. For the moment the gap between virtual and real-life is too large to use this kind of tools in decision-making. But I bet on the future to give the people the tools they need to make them participate and pass on the information to decision-makers. I do not trust the theories which say that we will automate everything and do not need a leader at the end. At least in practice, we will always need for someone responsible as regard of the taking decisions, writing the law, etc. There is always a moment where the professional is asked to give an advice or share his point of view that will go deeper than the average shared skill on a topic, even if they grow more and more. At the end, a vision is always needed as a system on which to lean the future planning.",
2020-03-12,16,382,Tel Aviv,Interview,Man,Eyal Feder-Levy,CEO,https://www.linkedin.com/in/eyalfeder/,Zencity,Startup,https://zencity.io/,"I’m 33 years old, I’m born in Boston, USA and have been raised in Tel Aviv. I have been a soldier of the unit 8200 for 5 years, afterward I spent time in social support : I managed The Garden Library, an NGO center for education, culture and art located in the work migrant neighborhood Neveh Sha’anan in south of Tel Aviv. I had there amazing experiences with the refugees, but I wanted to build something from the ground, I started to consider entrepreneurship. I passed a bachelor degree in Computer Science at Tel Aviv University, and a master degree in Urban Planning. I came soon to the Smart-City concept and the use of data to improve cities. I have been part of the founding team of the Urban Research Center of Tel Aviv University and I managed the institute for one year. I met my co-founder there, and created a startup to make a bigger impact than in the academic. We started with an Hackathon in Tel Aviv Municipality, we built a transit app, and then three more ideas that failed. After three years of failing companies, we created ZenCity and started with a first customer in Eilat, a small city in the south of Israel. We raised 1.7 million USD in 2017, the goal was to enter the US market. Our first customer in USA was Sacramento, capital city of California. We had about 10 customers in 2018, and raised 6 million USD from the Israeli venture capital Vertex to expand the product. We are now working with 120 cities in USA and Israel, 1 in Canada and 1 in Bosnia.","We believe that local governments are very poor in organization and but they still have a huge impact on our lives : both directly and indirectly. They have a big challenge to make the inhabitants lives better, and they spend huge budget for it. So we try to make them realize that and to be more sensitive to their responsibility on the lives of the people. For example, Tel Aviv spend 3.5 Billion Shekel a year, they hire 12.000 civil employees to work for the city, but they have no idea if they are doing a good job or not. I mean, they do not have any tools, like key performance indicators, to evaluate the efficiency and the quality of their politics. Once deployed, they can’t check directly how people are happy or not. So we propose scalable, real-time analysis on the feelings of the people.","We develop a platform linked to the API of the main social networks : Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, LinkedIn. We use automatic translation and natural language processing to analyse the publications and the online exchanges of the people of a targeted area. The service is only B2B, we dedicate our tool to municipalities, we do not make any B2C. We are not so many doing that : Citibeats is a Spanish competitor. Zencity do not need any network engagement. Indeed, the people are passive in our model : we collect the public data they spread on the web while they do not even know that we are doing it. We provide a cyber-governance tool, absolutely GDPR compliant. By the way, I come from the bottom-up approach of urban science, and I apply it by building a bridge helping the people to influence the decisions of the local governments. Even if our customer is the one influenced rather than the influencers themselves. By delivering a service to the municipality, we offer a service to the citizens.",,,,"I do not believe so much in the Smart-City concept itself. I think it is more a sort of portmanteau word to attract institutional interests and investments. But for sure, we definitely need to add digital tools and data tools to the toolbox of governments and municipalities, to improve their processes and finances.",,,,,,
2020-03-18,17,383,Tel Aviv,Interview,Man,Yossi Dan,Consultancy,https://www.linkedin.com/in/yossidan/,Israel Smart-City Institute  ; French Tech Israel,SME,https://israelsmartcities.org/,"I’m born and have been raised in Paris, France. I came in Israel in 1985 to join the army and then I followed international marketing studies. I started my career in software market, to develop Adobe System in Israel. I animated startups and became founder and director of the startup accelerator Founder Institute in 2012. I’m now consultant in open innovation for 6 years. I outreach international companies with Israeli startups. I created the first urban innovation lab in Israel in 2016 in Harish. I won a European project H2020 called IoT EPI by identifying in 20 cities, some projects mature enough for Proof of Concepts in the city and co-developed it by Public-Private-Partnership. Now, I’m currently creating the first open innovation lab in Tel Aviv, supported by Bouygues and another industrial company, to work on Smart-City, mobility, safety and sustainable development, agritech and foodtech. It will be the fruit of my consultant work but also of some project from the ISCI.","My main objective is to build a sand-box for corporate companies and cities to work together in identifying the technological talents the most early as possible. This is the actual missing piece of the puzzle, because neither cities nor enterprises manage to work together with startups, it means too many risk and instability right now. So we want to reduce the unceasing noise out of the too high quantity of startups, by filtering them earlier and identify sooner the ones providing the best quality of innovation that makes the better sense for a city, and give the management to the key accounts from corporate wish know exactly how to deploy the projects. In Israel we have the luck to have almost 300 innovation labs supported by international corporate companies, and I want to use this network to bring more corporate in Israel, in capacity to deploy vertical integration. With the Open Innovation Lab, we want to experiment in Israel and co-develop the solutions through corporate networks outside of Israel who want to import the Israeli technologies. To achieve this, co-design or design partnership seems to be one of the keys needed to unlock the power of entrepreneurs to change the world by changing the biggest corporate companies.","Some years ago, I created Founders Cafe, which grew up to a community of more than 2200 members. This is my talent’s engine in tech now. We organize a lot of meetups and events to push the selected members to integrate amid customers. To make the people meet themselves, we deploy regular tech challenges, from which we select the companies we are interested by (e.g.100 out of 6.000) Then we filter them again to work deeper with 12 only and finally we build a project with 2 or 3. We did it in the past, and we want to do the same in cities, but the main difficulty to achieve it is intern. We can’t be top-down in this market, it is needed to test, exchange a lot and leverage by giving the hand to many people. So we want to create a place where finally the mayor can be aware on the people who talk to him.","We don’t have any relationship with the academicians: in Israel the Public-Private partnerships are the basis of the whole tech market. It helps to proof-test interesting projects in real-life conditions with a small budget, and attract investors and financial partners. There are plenty of Public-Private Partnerships, but there are no mechanisms to regulate this tech deployment or to force cities to buy startup products. As for civil society, it is very active in Israel, especially in times of crisis. Even if the state spends a lot in the army, the network of civil association is big and efficient.",,,,,,,,"Can you tell me some words about the French Tech Israel ? In France, though the public investment bank BPI, the state supports the innovative enterprises. In Israel, the public sector never invest in startups, what they propose is to double the private investments at certain conditions. By the way France and Israel do not apply the same definition for startups: in France all enterprises which works in tech or the internet is considered as a startup, whatever its business model or potential scalability. In Israel they look at the potential sustainability of the business first. Finally it is considered that there are 10.000 startups in France and 6.000 in Israel but it is very different. When Macron was the French Minister of the Economy, the first project of French Tech started, the co-founders of FT Israel started, about 4 or 5 years ago. The projects was in the hands of politics, embassies etc. depending of the ministry. Last year a new committee changed the management to let the decisions to local entrepreneurs, supported by politics which do not decide anymore. French Tech Israel has been validate again by the new deciders. We are working on a big event for the France-Israel Innovation. we are waiting the end of the corona crisis to see how it goes. The objectives are not only to bring the French corporate companies in Israel, but also to link French startups to co-design solutions with Israeli startups. As a final goal, we would like to see how the Israeli startup can use France as an entrance door to deploy Israeli tech in the whole Europe.",
2020-03-23,18,384,Tel Aviv,Interview,Woman,Yael Malatskey,Head of Innovation,https://www.linkedin.com/in/yael-malatskey-7842ab64/,Cityzone,Startup Incubator,https://www.city-zone.co/,"I started to work at the Ministry of Economy : there are innovative missions to strength the relationships between the government, the economy and the actors in the different industries : agronomy, education, etc. I have been in charge with the Smart-City mission. Then I worked for WeWork, in charge of partnership at the national scale. I created a lot a relationships, my job was to connect personally with people and link them together. At this moment, I understood that I really like to understand the personality of my contacts, and try to find the best way to connect them well with the whole innovative ecosystem. Now I’m the head of the innovation ecosystem management at CityZone, an innovation lab established as a cooperation between Tel Aviv Municipality, Tel Aviv University and Business Park Kiryat Atidim Tel Aviv. We went in Smart-City Expo World Congress in Barcelona last year, our boss Gabi did a keynote intro to present CityZoom Urban Innovation Community.","CityZoom is a small thing in a huge ecosystem of animation around CityZone. By civic hacking we promote the use of open platforms of government and cities to address problems with hackers and programmers. We organized a Hackathon which was not referring to all political issues : it was based on the data available online. This was part of Hasadna for public knowledge, idea to take data and knowledge from government and create an open line to programmers so they can work on it. Most of the participants to the Hackathon have their week jobs so it didn’t gave so many startup pursuing afterward. CityZone is a sand box for all tech trying to integrate the city. In our living lab we are also operating a startup program, during which startups test their products, get access to data, combine with each others etc. We are public but we work as a company: we rise venture capital, and we constantly look for partner cities in the world.","The strategy is very basic : it consists in taking contact with the most of people by knocking at their doors. It’s not sales by the way, even if I fix goals for myself like “50 startups needs to join this event”. The network management asks for understanding the motivation of the partners, what are they looking for, who can be the most beneficial for their startups etc. It’s needed to be active, to talk a lot, to have skills of network builder and of connector. It’s kind of hard to explain the magic… I work like an automate : I know what I have to do to make it happen, so I do it naturally, without thinking. As a child I was living in a army base : both my parents where soldiers. So I spent my childhood moving over the country and changing school often. You always have to find friends, to integrate in groups of people you do not know… I probably developed skills to map the people, to identify who is the king of the classroom, to evaluate the others and find a way to maintain good relationships. This is probably the best education for being a network manager.",,"Cityzone host almost 40 challengers dealing with transportation and mobility. So yes our ecosystem of startups target very material change on the city. As I can follow their progression, I can imagine that they will make a big exponential growth in automatic transportation. Mobility is a hug issue in Tel Aviv : there are about 1.5 million people commuting everyday in the city, 3 times more than the residents which are about 500K. This is a big challenge, asking for a lot of infrastructure, data and urban planning. At Citizone, we look for potential startup to solve this problem. At a mainstream scale, the concept Mobility As A Service tries to avoid private transportation on the city. It is relevant to notice here that there are two main categories of startups working on urban issues. The ones promoting the Smart-City model, which usually work at a larger scale, trying to sell new IT infrastructure to the local governments and city managers, and the urban tech providers who have different business model : they sell some products to the residents directly, and they have an impact on the city transformation too. They also collect a lot of information and knowledge about the needs and habits of the inhabitants, the shop owners, the small businesses, etc.","Our job is not to communicate with residents, this is the role of the municipality. What we do the most in terms of communication to ease innovation processes, is to selves as a translator between the city employees and the startups, to make each other understandable. This is very funny because they both speak Hebrew, but this is not the same language by the way. So we usually have to write the same email in two different Hebrew language for both the two concerned parts of the agreement to understand each other. When we are confronted to people who have problem on the ground, we have to explain them what we are doing to solve their issue. It’s a lot about communication methodologies. But Tel Aviv is a tech bubble, so most residents are tech oriented, and it’s obvious for them to trust technology. Another problem for new startups is that from a city manager point of view, corporate companies are very stable, and resilient in facing crisis like the Covid-19 for example. So the municipality will more easily tend to work with them rather that new actors, even if it’s more expensive.",,,,"Yes we use an Ecosystem Relationship Management called ClickSoftware. It is an Israeli company now owned by Salesforce. It helps to learn from other cities too. But I mainly use my phone, and pen with notebook to meet people in person. I hate video meetings, this is not the same feeling.",,,

PhD first, now director of research and innovation lab in TalTech, under the ministry of economics and communication. We work on the topics of mobility, energy, and innovation pilots. We have one robot bus in a testing phase, open for everybody through the living lab device. Generally collaborators comes with an interest for our e-government and then they stay for our digital transformation programs. The lab has been created by my own initiative, we compete in European Founding 5 years ago, went through several evaluations and received seed founds last year. We are operational since December 2019, but started to develop our business plan from 2016. The Estonian government came in 2020.","Our end goal is doing research and development for cities, helping them to introduce new technologies, to be more inclusive. We work on solving urbanization issues, closely with cities but mainly doing actual R&D. We look for partnering with cities to demonstrate our solutions, inside and outside of Estonia. Operationally, we want to grow and have a sustainable business model. We gather many researchers from different universities at the Smart-City Center of Excellence. Our Lab aim to provide the best research on this topic. We open competitions for external people to be linked, and also collaborate with cities in several contexts. We are founding some research activities and involve the cities in the process. We do not specifically promote one product : we are very engaged in data platforms for and between cities. We are not tech-driven but rather research and urban-challenge driven, so we can help cities on their own issues. Our Urban OS is an open platform that we continue to work on.",,"We compete for receiving founds for research and we are quite good at it. We managed to be founded by European Union and Estonian Government. We have quite good connections with ICT companies, strong partnerships with local companies too, and with some historic partners from Finland. As for the civil society side, we are quite well connected with the smart-city lab from Tartu and other non-profit organizations on this topic. Also with the association of architects.",,"There are obviously conflicts between business, government and academia. We are not specialized in analyzing it and we have not looked into it specifically. For my point of view, I can say that some cities are more open to innovation than others, that is true. Tallinn for example is allowing companies to test innovation in a more liberal way. Helsinki has been more restrictive and look for something more stable before deployment. Both position gives better success in each case.","We have an open approach, we communicate, we organize talks and we report what kind of activities and pilots we are working on. This constitutes our approach to the local communities. We organize several events like seminars, workshops where every one can join. We try to include all people interested in Smart-City.",,,"There are very little research on decision-making and smart-governance concepts. This process usually never ends and we do not know where to start. The participation of citizens to open platforms is very low in general. But if there are very critical issues, the people can participate punctually.
=> he likes my approach of comparative studies, not based on desk research but jumping for real in my territories. It is very great, it gives a very good foundation to my PhD.",,"6. You are at the origin of the creation of Finest Twins, can you tell me more about the Twin Smart-City initiative between Helsinki and Tallinn ? This collaboration comes first to ease the mobility between cross border cities. It is important to see how the services can be cross-border as well. The people which travel in both cities should have more non-cash systems for parking or tickets that work in the two cities. Actually, with the digitalization of services, it gets more complex for tourists and citizens to move from one city to another one and get access to services, while it should be the contrary. Finest Twins aims to integrate the IT systems in a cross border context. The Sub-Sea tunnel is not directly linked to Finest Twins, even if the have had common visibility. Some technical and financial analysis have been done but there are currently a few arguments in favor of this project. ;",
2020-06-24,20,386,Tallinn,Interview,Man,Yannick le Moullec,Professor,https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannicklemoullec/,TalTech University,Academic Research,,"I am professor at TalTech for 6 and half years. I worked almost 10 years in Aalborg University in Denmark before. When my contract ended there, a job opportunity was opened in Tallinn and so I came in 2013. Estonia were even less famous than what it is nowadays. I came for 2 years initially, but it continued. I am related to the Thomas Johann Department of Electronics, from the School of IT. We work on developing tech : IoT, sensors, on the communicating aspects, wireless, radio and networks. I am not the most engaged on the software side, but some of my colleagues do. For example, we started a project called 5G-routes, we are experimenting a 5G corridor between Helsinki and Riga, to test future applications on roads, maritime, trains, etc. We test the continuity of services, etc.","Interesting to be able to talk about the 5G. We can see a lot of criticism on social networks. What’s your point of view about that ? Yes indeed, in Estonia too we have had alerts on the 5G risks for human and environment. From my point of view and from what I can read from my research fellows, there is no reason to be afraid. The 5G frequencies are obviously higher than the 3G and 4G, but they are still classic radio frequencies. Furthermore, the topology of the networks are based on smaller cells, less powerful in terms of emission that what we had until now. So of course we will have more antennas but they will send less powerful signals.","Not so much for the moment, but this goal is part of the criteria for evaluation of teaching and research staff, and the university policy. In the last few years, we published 3 mainstream articles in mass media to explain our work and tell the population how our developments can be useful to society. We have another project financed by the European Union Interreg Program, regarding the lightening of public spaces. We are part of a network of pilot cities to replace the current city lightening with LED-based technology. The objective is not only smart-tech : it also reaches the environmental aspects, social and economic ones. We work with the city of Tallinn to make it a pilot. A great survey has been done across Tallinn population to understand how the people use the different parks of the city. Tallinn “green belt” is a visible series of parks areas around the old town and we wanted to understand how to make it more user-friendly. The results have been interesting and now we are starting a first on-site experiment in Kanuti Garden, currently under call for tender.","Generally speaking, academic staff in Estonia are not public servant as can be the case in some other countries. In addition to the base funding that the university receives, we also depend a lot on projects, or when the government launch tenders, which are very competitive. In addition to Estonian national funding, we are also through the European Union on projects. We also do applied research in collaboration with the industry. These agreements between academic and private sector are done on the base of pre-existing contacts. For example, the applied research financing tool Nutikas aims to implement the Estonian smart-specialization strategy across the whole Europe with other rograms. In spite of these ways to obtain funds, the relative insufficiency of public financing creates a certain precariousness for researchers and perceived lack of attractiveness. It is well known that in some domains, it is quite hard to enroll Estonian PhD students as the conditions in the industry can be more attractive. At a global scale, private companies like the GAFAM have huge financing power comparing to universities of small and medium size. As a result, more and more research and development is made in the private sector companies, not anymore at the university.","A self-driving electric minibus has been developed mainly at TalTech. The project of Smart-Campus which aimed to become an open laboratory of tech, impulsed by the 5G network existing on the campus, has been driven by high level executives of the university, in collaboration with intermediaries of each departments. It has been quite challenging to receive funds but now we expect that this self-driving bus can be a way to open a door for other in-situ experiements.","Conservative vote at the last national election, seems to be a bad signal for innovation. In practice, there is always a delay between what happens at a political level and the academic research. For the moment nothing have changed significantly, as far as I am concerned. The presidential election do not plays a significant role in universities intern guide lines. But this election has been interesting in regard of political processes : Estonia has a system a Great Elective, not a universal voting system and none of the 3 candidates received a victory. Somewhat unusually, Kaljulaid was elected president only after other candidates could not be elected in three rounds of voting an electoral college consisting of members of Parliament and representatives of local governments of Estonia. So the government designated a president, an official head of the state, even if the prime minister has a more important role for the Estonian politic. But some conservatives entered in the Estonian parliament and tends to slow the liberal startup mindset it has been before. Something else is that Estonia has one of the highest number of startups per capita of Europe, and it maybe went to a maximum critical rate. Many academics have their own company or startup too, but it appears that often it is rather dormant or remain very small and has no big achievements.",,,,,,"How about the Russian-Estonian relationships in Tallinn ? We can read all and its contrary on this topic. From my point of view, it depends a lot on generations : the fracture between East and West culture has been bridged for new generations. According to some surveys, it appears that most of Russian-Speaking Estonians are happier to live in Estonia rather than what it could be to live in Russia. The quality of life, security, openness of opinions. They do not have the willingness to influence Estonia to make it more Russian, and this topic is serious enough for the Estonian TV to have launched a Russia-speaking channel to balance the influence of Russian TV in Estonia.",
2020-06-25,21,387,Tallinn,Interview,Woman,Suzanne Durst,Professor,https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanne-durst-13b733a/,TalTech University,Academic Research,,"I define myself as an outlier in terms of background: I originally come from Germany. I am a trained import-export clerk but wasn’t interested in working in this profession. So I started to study psychology, sociology and political science with a minor in economics. I was very interested in cultural sociology. I did all this until my pre-diploma. Then I switched to the study of business administration with a major in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and completed it with a Diploma. In 2000, during the first wave of IT and e-Commerce, I had an IT consultant activity with a focus on digitalization of the insurance. I was involved in a e-commerce project of a platform for used cars. I spent some time doing that but had the feeling I should continue with my studies. I moved to Sweden for family reasons, and specialized myself with a master degree in Finance. As the job market in Sweden was (and still is) very small and foreigners with no specific expertise did not have so much opportunities at that period of time, thus I went back to Germany and assumed positions in finance and controlling. Yet my hunger for more academic studies was still there. As I was working full time, I started looking for a PhD that could be done remotely, and got me in touch with University of Liechtenstein that run cooperative doctorates. They offered me a position as a project member in an Interreg project aimed at developing a marketing and branding strategy for the Alpine Space. In addition to this job I pursued my PhD studies (I was enrolled as a PhD student at a University in Paris) I stayed there and moved up from this position to be one of an assistant professor. During that time, I had the chance to spend longer periods at Universities in Ferrara and Helsinki. I also kept my contacts with the Swedish University I earned my Master degree from and came finally back to Sweden to start a position as a senior lecturer in business administration with a focus on Marketing in 2014 and in 2018 I became a full professor. During this period, I spent some time at a university of Lima. In 2019, I learned that the TalTech university was looking for a full-time professors in management. I applied and got the job. All in one, I can say that I am a European product of academia.","In my PhD studies I researched the role of intangible assets in business transfers of small and medium-sized enterprises taking the perspective of buyers. I attended to a maximum of scientific conferences to meet people and spread my ideas with people working in similar fields to check if I had something of interest for the research community. I am still working with many of those people I met in those days, we followed ourselves all this time. I like to work with people I can have fun with but also do hard work with. I look for the matching chemistry.","In terms of stakeholders from a research point of view, for any research project, I am interested in having discussions with people from other disciplines. Of course, this can take more time to start because we need to understand each other’s language and vocabulary, but my conviction is that it increases the impact of research. I am very much into keeping the level of re-inventing the wheel at the minimum, by working together with people from different disciplines and professions this can somewhat be reduced. Given my background, I try to stay very close to the business world too.","Using my relational capital developed over the years, and that I am continuously developing further, I try to find supporters and investors for my academic research. For example, a friend of mine works at the Chamber of Commerce, so even if I just arrived in Tallinn, through her it has been very easy to get in touch with entrepreneurs willing to participate in a COVID-19 related study. having been a foreigner in many different countries, I have learned that you need this local door openers.","To address the societal challenges ahead (e.g. transportation, energy, the consequences of COVID-19), online and offline forums need to be there that bring together many stakeholders (e.g. ordinary citizens, students, researchers, policy makers, the business side, visitors of Tallinn/Estonia) as possible. I consider this key for successful transformations and innovations, particular for a country as small as Estonia; it will also help my ongoing and forthcoming studies.",,,,,,,,
2020-06-25,22,388,Tallinn,Interview,Man,Angelo Sorbello,Enterpreneur,https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelosorbello/,AstroGrowth,Startup,,"My experience tells about how things do not work so well in some places where everything was working very well some decades ago. Italy used to be a great spot to live and make business. Now it is not anymore. I was a nerd making business very young, I starting a blog about video games at 13 years old. By looking how to get traffic on my website, with no money to pay for advertisement, I learned SEO. At 15 years old, I was ranked as the first blog for video games in Italy. At that time I have been contacted by Microsoft and other big companies. It gave me the feeling that it was possible to live a different life style. I went to a business school after high-school. All my friends wanted to be bankers or consultant. As for me, following my earlier personal experiences I wanted to become a full time entrepreneur, to be free, and I start back doing stuff online. I came in Estonia first for an Erasmus program. I was always attracted by the Nordic culture and the contrast with Sicilia where I am from. My next websites didn’t manage to go global in despite of my attempts : at a global level, USA is much more attractive to make views and reach traffic and it is very hard to compete. But I learned more about startups and did some consultancy work too. Now I have this software comparison site which makes quite good results in terms of visitors per month. I don’t think to be smarter than others, but I work a lot. I have degrees in different universities, but I wished to have my office in Italy and live here. The main problem is that the bureaucracy is crazy and the public offices do not work anymore. I had a client that had to pay me but I couldn’t do the procedure to get the money from abroad. In the public office, no one responded me. I have had to use a friend of my father to have a response, which is so disappointing : it is needed to have a personal relationship inside the public administration to make it work. I finally receive an answer that was not positive : in order to get my money, I needed to wait more time and pay an extra fee. so I took the e-residency and moved my company on the Estonian e-State services. I was much more easy to do it this way.",,,"Do you have any relationships with startups in Estonia?  Not really, the ecosystem is very tech-oriented there. I am not in this kind of business.",,,,,,,,"Do you come back in Tallinn sometimes ? Not often : the plane connection is not direct and it makes it hard to come. In march I went back for the first time in the last 4 years.
	.	Anything else you would like to tell about your e-resident experience ? The e-residency branding is very good, but I have lived most of my time in Lisbon, Portugal, those last years. And the last time I came to Tallinn, I realized how Portugal succeed in attracting digital nomads. They do a better job in terms of inclusion, which is probably cultural. In two weeks in Lisbon, I did more friends than all my stay in Tallinn. I have lived in Warsaw, Milan, Germany, Tallinn… Finally in Tallinn there are not so much events to include foreigners. I love the Nordic culture and the Estonian one, but I think they could benefit a lot of making their ecosystem more inclusive. It has been hard with the bank too : TransferWise took a long time to validate my account. On the official website of e-residency, they say you can use a Paypal account for your business, but once you subscribe Paypal and reach a certain amount of income, you are banned. At this moment, the e-residency became not anymore interesting for me. I keep thinking that the e-residency is a awesome thing, to prove the world how could be our future on its best way. But it seems that the world is not ready for it. And the FinTech are not really ready neither. The taxation of a digital nomad is not clear neither : the administrations do not know how to deal with it.",

I was always interested in games but never believed I could make a career out of it. So I started with marketing and producing TV commercial videos. I have been inspired by friends and launched a startup in 2006 in game industry and made money. At that time there were no so much support or resources for startups. So I learned a lot by myself. When I sold it I did some money and learned from my mistakes. I started another company that didn’t work. Another one on FinTech, to make money by playing games. I continued startups with Techstars in 2011 in Seatlle and then I move to London in 2013. I was mentoring at Techstars and worked for a tech company. In 2015, a company was looking for a head of product in Tallinn, and this is how I moved here. I developed the free product to the paid product, and then took the charge of growth in 2017.","We have a lot to grow. I use a framework of growth loop model. Whatever action the customer does in interaction with our product, I use the result to reinvest the value of it in a growth objective. The best strategy to grow is that each time a person have a good experience with your product, he will tell friends, and so they will become customers. The content marketing approach can attract more people too. It is needed to understanding all those loops, quantitative and qualitative and find which one prioritize on your road map.",,"We are a private company. We successfully raised seed money and a first venture round at 10M$ in 2014. Then a second series at 15M$ in 2016, in two times. It is a concentrate mix of angels, including young talents, a couple of VCs, and some locals : Tera Ventures, a VC out of Finland called Inventure, and also a japanese corporation.","Well, I used to be in the top 10 of gamification guru. I am a big fan of it and the products link lightly to gamify. But I prefer to talk about motivational design, which is more critical for anything. The startups have simple needs, like talent acquisition. Tallinn have improved in that regard : it was hard to get a work permit at the beginning. The infrastructure was not set up very well, it is very better now, and it helps. We hire remote workers all over Europe and it is a very chance to help people live in their cities. As for me, I was wroking in london for my first company and have been very interested to join Tallinn. I liked it since I discovered that the startup ecosystem is very dense and performative. They have a sort of Silicon Valley mindset : people help each other to grow startups and it creates a mentality and an ecosystem. I have seen the same in Tallinn : Skype has create a huge pool. And then you can’t spend so much money around here, a nice house is half a million. So the wealthiest people invest in supporting more companies. The tax rate is very attractive, the quality of live, the free public transportation, a cheap internet, the city is doing a very good job. They could do more in terms of discrimination to attract more talents. Culturally they are kind of suspicious on foreigners and they could have much better results if they were more open.",,,,,,,"What is it needed to develop a startup city ? Talents, access to capital, infrastructure and technical connectivity, communication, places to live… You need a big enough pool to scale. The structures already exist, as well as the government attitude. Of course the last election didn’t help them : the conservative/xenophobic party. You need more open people to bring here more talents. It probably works with the educational system. And entrepreneurial involvement in that educational system, for people to see that this is the way to raise. But of course, this mistrust in startups has an explanation : there are 2 categories of economy here : the people in tech who make money and spend, and the non-tech people that sell services to tech people but make less money. And there is a gap in between those two categories. So it is needed to invest the money from tech startups in the local community for everyone to understand the benefit of this economy. If not, the situation is not sustainable and will create breach between the people. I can imagine that more animosity between the people have been raising those last years, frustration, jealousy.",

I started to invest in startups in 2000, all quite small companies (under 100 employees) and I sold my shares of the last one in 2017. Now I have 41 companies in portfollio with 10 direct investment through incubators program. I am mentoring at Startup Wise Guys, and in Technopol.","How do you support startups apart of investing ?  Some founders do not have the experience of managing people, or to deal with the corporate governance. I have the experience and help to avoid crucial errors. I help with the strategy too : some young startups do typical errors: not enough focus, too many things at the same time. I don't invest so much in Urban Innovation, My main business area is B2B : companies attacking old industries with new solutions that bring 2/3 times more effectiveness.",,"The government has tried to keep the startup ecosystem thin. They help, they engage in business and so this is how they get money from it. All book keeping, taxes and business establishment are very easy to do remotely in Estonia, so this has helped a lot for the Estonian state to attract and keep all these startups. Then of course the money laundry issue and the preference to know customers has made more difficult if you are not in Tallinn to open a bank account. When they were under soviet rule, they had nothing so they started from scratch in the 90’s. This is always easier than to have a huge and costly legal system like old democracies. Estonia had an open mind to all what came from western Europe and US, which helped a lot to take the good decisions at that time. They do not have that much of one-man rule. It is rather the young leaders which create good working environment and motivate people. This make programmers, engineers, workers much more effective, because using their all potential, taking initiatives. They do not have capital accumulation or knowledge accumulation here, but it is changing quite fast : the students which go study abroad, come back with know-how and good stuff to implement from abroad. Estonia became one of the most shining place in Eastern Europe for new enterprises and new economy. They have the most unicorn per capita (5 to 6 for 1,5 million people) and this helps to make a good environment for business. A lot of development happens here : they do code, then sales and management can be incorporate somewhere else. Because they have to scale outside by the way, it is somehow better to have the selling department abroad. The local sandbox is good here, and then jump in the real market abroad. When a company is founded in France or Germany, there are not so much English-speaking inside, and they rather stay on a local market scale which is enough.",Startups and entrepreneurs are a minority over the overall population. So most of the countries in the world pushes on more taxes and result in creating a bad environment for startups. The Estonian balance is good.,,,,,,,"What else makes Estonia a great launchpad for startups ? Most help from the government is that they have kept all these taxing and the corporate governance so easy that you can keep growing a business and do your own accountancy, tax payment by yourself. You do not need someone else because the legal environment is not complex. They also made development founds and started to invest in startups. They didn’t had any foreign founds at the beginning and so the government invested money in good startups. It was always co-investment founds with local angels, but this helped a lot to start the ecosystem. Now it is re-organized, they do not invest anymore, and play like limited partners. They still have an incubator with good mentors. The City if Tallinn is also part of Technopol, where they are helping really young companies with mentoring and office base. There is also an Estonian Investment Agency and a development agency from the government called Enterprise Estonia with some financing programs.",

I did mostly marketing and communication jobs. The Estonian Science Council is managed by the public sector Estonian Research Council which depends on the Minister of Education and Research, but the funds come from European Union until 2022. Then we will have to find other resources or programs. The council officially started in 2012 with the main goal to marketize of Estonian Science and to make it more visible internationally. They target more researchers to come in Estonia, as they do with other brands like study in Estonia, work in Estonia, etc. They have this small part related to research with an identity building mission and promoting something else than startup only. Estonia has a world-class science and it has to be known too.","Our main activity is to empower science communication people in Estonia or under universities. We train them to make their job better, we provide contacts with science journalists and with other countries. We set up the web page with more info on Estonian institutions, a news feed and the great stuff that have been done in Estonia so far. Estonian Research Council help researchers to get funds from Estonia or from Europe, they do not invest in research directly. They do not manage the funds neither, but the main problem to address is that the private sector do not put money or not enough into non-physical property. This is a big goal for Estonia in the years to come : increase private sector funds and cooperation between companies and researchers.",,"We have connections with non-profit organizations, and also private businesses. We can help to get better evaluation from the minister of education and research. no matter where they come from. We invite different Estonian companies to go to fairs together under the brand “Enterprise Estonia”, we are all partners in a way, so we usually do pretty much cooperation with different branches of government.",,,,,,,,"Do you communicate on Tallinn Smart-City research ? We do not target Tallinn specifically.We do not have separate projects but of course the researchers have some projects related to smart-city. We are giving some grants to researchers who work on some projects. We have tried to help researchers to go to international fairs too, like the smart-city expo in Barcelona. We called researchers to propose a founding of travel expanses if they wished to participate. We try to promote some solutions for smart-city that are research related, like smart solutions for pedestrian stripes like we recently promoted.",

Then I have been working in a startup. I was organizing the Startup Week Tallinn and have been approached like that. Now I am working for 1,5 year in Startup Estonia. I am taking care of the startup community. We have a wide network in startups and startuping the organisations. We provide incubators, accelerators, VC founds, we manage 100 organizations and do a lot of projects with them. We also provide a lot of offers to startups : pitching competitions, opportunities to go abroad.","Startup Estonia were launched in 2015. Our main goal is to boost and develop Startups in Estonia by providing events and support, and a legislative adaptation to startup success.","We are a public organization, depending on the Ministry of Economy and Communication. We operate under Credex, a financial institution. We have a good trust with the community of startups. We receive all the data and analysis from the community and from the Ministry of the Economy, so we can make a bridge in between those two worlds. The startup ecosystem in Tallinn is growing 30% per year. In a few years, we came to 1000 startups. We have a public procurement to launch initiatives, an accelerator, and incubators programs. We also launch projects for kids and young people, a lot of very different things. We are not offering money directly, we offer databases, and have offered money to start a SuperAngel VC which is now operating on this own.","Startup Estonia is a connector between government and startups. We have a lot of contact in the academic field too, with local governments and regional institutions. We work with some of civil movements by time to time, and have contacts with investors. The investors are not hard to reach., this is one of the key advantages. Estonian startup scene is very dense so when you know two people, you can easily connect with a third one related. Most community organisations are NGOs (garage 48 for example) and most of the animation of startups are NGOs too. They get their money from European projects.","Estonian government is very supportive, Tallinn is not really. For most foreigners that come to Tallinn, there are too many gaps to get information for the first steps as most officials do not speak English. So more support to foreigners are still needed. Tallinn entrepreneurship is good but the support must be translated in English. In Helsinki they have 10 different languages, they have more money of course, but so they attract more foreigners. The inclusiveness in startup community is there, but there are many things the government can’t do, and if Tallinn want to maintain this image of welcoming startup city, they need to do more as for children education, health, and public services access to foreigners. Tartu for example is much better in international services.","This is indicated by the last national voting result. This tendenci=y in the population exists definitely. In Estonia, there is a very small portion of population which gets an instant success from startup. The overall population have it very difficult. The startup revenues grows 10 times as fast as the general GDP growth : from 3% in general to 30% in startups. It is not possible to bring that success to the whole population, but young people who finish their studies, know exactly what happens in startups and so they want to jump in it. The scene exists in Tallinn, Tartu, but not in other cities and in the countrysides. The startup uses a lot of foreign language, so the Estonian language institute try to bring this topic to the ordinary people, in native language. A realistic optimism about startups is that they need to address this gap to become sustainable and stay on the long term.",,,,,,,

It is organized by the embassy. They have some kind of person from Enterprise Estonia too and a sort of group / network but I am not part of it. ; 
Do you feel that there is a common culture across the Baltic Sea ? Yes and no. It is hard to tell because I did many expat friends from all over the world.

I arrived and started in a EU project looking at Helsinki-Tallinn relationships. How people are moving, what are they moving for, and what are the companies doing. I have a background in transportation but a lot of other issues as well. And I have been working on the feasibility study of the tunnel between Helsinki Tallinn.","The main goal is to integrate services. A first program was defined in 2014 and now we work on the second one from 2019. It define the focus areas we are working on together. The first focus of studies was on transport connection and the potential tunnel. N ow we look for social and cultural relationships and provide rather people-related studies. We work on project-based developments like feasibility studies. Innovative projects and solutions in smart mobility systems, usually EU founded projects. Finest twins is the biggest project so far. The Living Lab knowledge transfer with special institute and universities is a core part or our collaboration too.","Any project nowadays means stakeholder engagement. We always have some issues that need to get worked together and the main point is that it is very important to engage corporate companies. There are still two different cultures between Estonia and Finland, the people do not work the same and do not have the same issues nor the same history. So it is needed to know the people closely. Our two innovative districts of Helsinki : Yatkasaari (smart-transportation) and Kalasatama (smart-city) are both working very closely with Tallinn.","We are very close to the City of Tallinn and other authorities in Estonia. We also have very good contacts with academic world. Because we are a public sector organization, we have to be close to companies but not so much. About the civil society, we have contacts with the people of Helsinki but not so much with the ones of Tallinn. The startup community is very strong in Helsinki too. The staff of city of Helsinki is maybe 10 times bigger than Tallinn, so it can appear that we take more academic work, but not always. It is very important to balance the leadership in order to maintain good relationships on the long term.","We are building a very large scale kind of Twin City. We do not know yet what will be integrated at the end. We actually work a lot on integrating business and tech societies and creativity together. If one side lack of work force or want university research, so they can have it quickly from the other side. An important social issues for example is that if you have a diploma in a country, it can be directly applicable in the other. So we do not focus on a specific infrastructure, like a tramway or something like that which must integrate the 2 cities. We are more on the people side.",,,,,,,"Can you tell me more about the tunnel project ? It is a very long term plan, but before to start it will take 5 to 10 years. We need to draw plans both for implementation and geographical study, and the planning. It will take a lot of time. We are doing some preliminary studies. We will probably build it one day, but we do not have any founding now and this is not the priority of the agenda. This projects must be financed by countries and cities. In order to finance it, we need strong studies and feasibility to know how much it will cost and how to achieve it the best way.",

It was a traditional company doing content marketing, and I expanded it to Nordic countries, and then to Middle East and Asia. I sold it in 2014. At that time startups started to emerge and we did quite many investments starting from 2012. I lived in Dubai from 2012 to 2014 and then moved to Singapore in early 2014. When I sold the company, I had more capital to invest. I was traveling a lot and I was heavily using Uber in Singapore. This is how I get very interested in mobility. I had been in contact with the founder of Bolt in Estonia and so have been its first investor. This opportunity kicked me off. I get more and more interested in this topic, and specially how to make the transport more easy for users. What I look now is a super app to integrate all different apps and transport services for customers. I invested in a Columbian Unicorn Rappi, a Central America leader Super App Hugo, also the first Mexican Superapp Pronto, Latam second tier city Super App Apperto and the Algerian Super App YAssir trying to build the leading superapp in french speaking Africa.","I currently mainly focus on Mobility as a Service and Last-Mile Delivery start-ups. I travel a lot and observe issues: traffic, street worksites etc. The cities really need to look at the future and address these problems. I have invested in about 75 different companies, I learn a lot from the founders and help the local players to make them winners on their market. Not necessarily global leaders.","I do many fundraising for companies, mentorship in startup challenges, I help key players. I do networking, I am investor in hackathons, I take part to different growth camp. I selectively look at building my network in Europe, Nordic countries and US. I talk to many people. I constantly look for the next super startup, the unicorn leader to help as much as I can.","The network work a lot with the public sector, same for academics. I do not have a direct link with them but the networks are related and communicate each others. For example, my partners are deeply tight with the government. In Dubai the mobility innovation comes from a very close research public-private.","Tallinn looks like it works perfectly. The e-services are here for a long time, public transportation are free. Of course the tunnel to Helsinki would help to work more together with the 2 cities. It will make it a better place for global investors. Tallinn is a small package where things work very well.","Not really. These days, most people have internet and the sources to get information. If they want to work in IT company, learn code, become software developer, it is open and available for everyone. It is quite cheap to start and then to get an employment from a tech company. There is no reason for being against that.",,"I mainly try to talk with people who are founding startups, so they know about the concepts, and they are charged of public communication to the mainstream public. I focus on helping them in giving the best mentoring.",,,,,
2020-06-30,30,396,Tallinn,Interview,Woman,Amna Ahsan,Growth Hacker & Content Marketer,https://www.linkedin.com/in/amna-ahsan/,Thorgate,Startup,,"I originally come from Pakistan. I passed a bachelor in mathematics then I started my startup, I went to two different ventures, one co-founded it. At some point, I realized that something was missing : I had no knowledge in marketing and business. So I joined a master degree in Scotland in those fields. I started to apply around Europe, targeting countries very startup oriented : Estonia, Netherlands and Malta. I had my own startup idea and they usually look for woman in startup industry. Finally I started to work for an Estonian startup Crypto-wallet called Goodex Finance Network, an app that help to convert currencies, cryptocurrencies and gold. I applied in marketing and started working remotely from Pakistan. The company wanted to do an ICO, so I moved in Estonia in august 2018 to get closer to them. Once I get my ID card everything became very easy administratively. I have received a better offer from Target, another company (group of companies) with an intern software house, venture capital, and NGO in the group. They have a lot of startups in portfolio, and help them in development. So I am still connected with startups, and this is what I like, I never wanted to join corporate. I have heard last year that it was complicate for some people to move in Estonia. For me it was very smooth. I get my visa for Estonia in 5 days from UK, then I received a work visa for 6 months at my arrival here. I have been helped with the Estonian government police office to fill the documents to receive my ID card in 2 weeks. Now I can to my address changing, tax declaration online, very easily.","When I joined this group company, the goal was to help all the portfolio companies in marketing. But finally the goal move from the whole company as a group. We have to set up a marketing network inside the group. I guess my personal goal would be to be marketing consultant for the companies at the end.","Apart from my job, I am managing a Non-Profit called “Python Estonia”. The idea is to help Python Estonia in getting sponsors for the events or to get partners. And to have in their network the developers who can come and help. Usually we look for a speaker to talk about his startup or his experience, and by doing so we wish to create an ecosystem for startups that use python as a language, or developers who want to meet companies in order to collaborate or find a job. I try to integrate any one interested in Python language to network in Tallinn. We also target ventures, not just to invest capital but to give an access to the ecosystem. A lot of founders of startups use Python Estonia to grow their network. This is sort of an ecosystem. We have been helping a lot of startups by this way, giving unformal mentoring between experienced entrepreneurs and newbies or early project owners. The idea is to be able to connect all of them together. How to develop an app, how to get to the market, how to reach founds….","The academics more often because we work close to Taltech : the Python code club happens to Taltech and we can maybe be partners time to time. Also students can attend completely free, and a lot of our portfolio companies are closely tight of university. As for the public sector, we do not really have direct partnerships but I have heard about smart-city project involving startups. Within the industry partners we work for, there are Smart-City issues. They have create a software for smart-city lights, a smart-city platform for maintenance and safe energy cost. So we collaborate with them but do not have direct support from them.","I would suggest to work on an angle in terms of public relationships to make the law system a bit more integrate for startups. Something more digital. We recently had some cases that we won. There should be more sales of the startup ownership, but the system is not improved, it could be more efficient. Before the covid crisis, we were talking about many sales that are now crashed. The court must be more efficient.",,,"Not specifically on smart-city but we communicate through monthly digest to all persons which are part of our ecosystem, about innovations from our portfolio. We communicate to partners and all members concerned by the group level.",,,,,
2020-07-01,31,397,Tallinn,Interview,Man,Martin Männil,CIO at City of Tallinn,https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-m%C3%A4nnil-28845b74/,City of Tallinn,Public Service,,"I have an engineer background, I live in Tallinn. I have been working for the IRP department for more than 10 years. My main skills are software and financial software. I applied CIO with an ability to understand complex software problems, servers, networks, technology from technical part, information systems.","The technical part of the city needs to run. There are traditionally different levels in the city : the department level (officials) and the agency level (13.000 people). We have started to widen the IT domain from department to agencies, and are very close to do it. Which means that 250 agencies will be integrated to their department services. The end goal is to provide a city-wide platform and information services. In this area there are always room to improve. The data analysis and development projects, plus keeping the existing systems, maintain the workflow systems and the replacement of outdated tech/process, make it evolve with new legacy. We want to take advantage of digital ID and e-Signature which are the pillars of our e-Government services. My new challenge and strategy is Data-driven decision making. This is not traditionally the Estonian strength. We are good at digital transactions, tax report, applied for services, but decision-making is a new approach, and I try to build it on the City of Tallinn, which means all department must do the integration part. With a strong open data and a focus on the biggest impact by management of decision-making. We have found that many cases of service automation asks for the re-design of the service before. Usually IT systems comes from different partners and a global platform of public services asks for an UI/UX thinking more user-friendly. We are now thinking about how to integrate the smart-city issues in this refashion of our public services.","We haven’t been very good traditionally in it. But we found that citizens are not really interested. Our Western colleagues put a lot of emphasize in this kind of ethic of governance. As for ourselves, we tried to do it, but the citizens do not care about, they just ask for a good UX in order to use our products easily. The information we collect is that for every e-service, we take a direct feedback from the users. They do not really care about data privacy, of course they do not want us to use it for bad reasons, but they agree to share personal information with the government. It is maybe connected with soviet legacy, where citizen engagement didn’t existed.","We have very close relationships with private sector. At the IT department of the city we are a small unit of 40 employees, so we can manage the servers but we do not have no development team which would require much more employees. So we work with private sector. They bring ideas, we discuss with them with analytics and managers from the public sector. We also have a few relationships with academics, with no real impact. We do not have so many cooperation with them. As for the civil society, when it seems interesting to engage them, we do it. For example, we have launched a social shared transport, sort of Uber for disabled people, last year. We have bring together clients and city official, private city companies and city owned taxi companies, and of course we engaged the group of disabled people in this project.","We have made all our services available as e-service. All of the have web flow-management services behind. So we can say that the digital transformation is done. Of course you can apply for everything in paper but so city servant digitalize it manually. Most of the process is covered. There are still areas where there are rooms for improvement. The one we try to build up is the transport planning. We do not have the software tool to gather all the data from mobility and to analyse it or improve it by data-driven decisions. I think that decision-making should be supported by data lakes and all the data resources. But there are some legal restrictions like the GDPR. This new legacy didn’t changed much because we had similar data privacy law before, but it affected the way how the public sector focus on the issue of data. It blocks public sector in analyzing data from cameras or other sources. It would help if the legislation where lighter : in some cases it went too far. For example we have cameras on the street which can detect car speed and the detection of bus line violation. The tech is available, but the law do not allows to use it. Many things could be done technically, but we are blocked by some general legislation that do not consider the best use we could do of it. Fortunately, in Estonia, this issue of data privacy is nothing regarding the problems faced in the western countries, which sometimes refuse categorically the digital services for privacy issues.",,,"One of the reasons behind Estonian success, is that the public is quite well educated to these concepts. The general knowledge of population on tech innovation is quite good, so we do not do so much explanation as the city, which is usually done by the national government. When we have some new device, we communicate on it, but not on the concepts. The western governments emphasize the importance of technology, but here we have approached it differently : we have different public services, and must deliver it in the best way as possible. This mindset “delivering the best services” is another approach that becomes very enviable but not always practiced. In lot of cases, there is no need for AI or Machine Learning, these are tech innovations, arguments, that do not apply to the citizen point of view. For example here in Estonia, we do not have a need for blockchain, even if this is presented as the best for secure ID, because we already have built our own x-road system and e-signature. We are very proud that our services works well, and we will continue to make it improved always, to make a better government system. The digital transformation in public sector always recommend to start with legislation, then start with important pillars as we did : signature secure, identification secure, documents secure transfer.",,,,,
2020-07-01,32,398,Tallinn,Interview,Man,Krister Kalda,Technology Transfer Officer,https://www.linkedin.com/in/krister-kalda-bb409825/,TalTech University,Academic Research,,"I am currently writing a PhD in mobility as a service, micro-mobility and Smart-City. I was working 3 years in dealing with contracts between the university and companies, mostly dealing on intellectual property issues. I actually participate to the test of two self-driving cars. One is a French collaboration with a company called Novia, it is tested on a 1km line in Kadriorg park, and the other one as been built by TalTech and is in use on a 2,5km line between the airport and Ulemiste city. I am investigating how different demographic and environment influence what kind of attitude and service of maintenance is needed for the self-driving cars. Before that I worked on mobility test in the campus with the 5g and a smart-road material based on solar panel which you can use for zebras lightning or public lightning. We also used it to calculate the number of people walking on it. You can also use it to make sounds for disabled people, you can light it when a car arrives in rural area for less light pollution on the environment. We participate to the establishment of the smart-city center of excellence. Ralf-Martin Soe is one of my tutors. I have been asked to make a PhD they are supervising. By having worked from the university, they knew me and they wanted to experiment more about the ongoing developments. The TalTech self-driving car is produced by urban tech startups. We have an interest now in starting the commercialization. We have produced 6 cars so far and 5 are in the making. We developed it as an open-source hardware called ISEAUTO. Everything is posted on youtube.","At the moment, we have a strong collaboration with Finland. We are sharing developments : they bought our self-driving car model. Our goals are to improve ICT solutions and smart-city, smart-energy systems by sharing knowledge. We also aim to develop new things on top of the things we already have. We just collaborate with Tech university of Munich on this car. The car was physically in Estonia, but driven by internet from Munich. There are endless possibilities to develop collaborations like that. We do the same with Tartu, our goal is to develop the market further. I am also interest in cyber-security issues, we have a quite strong department at the university. We helped implement the NATO center. Cyber-security is a really important topic in all the smart-city area, because malicious people can take over, especially the self-driving car. There is not one goal or idea, but to develop the campus as a smart-city test base and collaborate with Finland and get more doctors and master students a chance to change the world.","We do hardcore marketing, videos on all what we are developing (e-payment, cars, …) we collaborate with research organizations, mostly universities, for ex Singapore last year to help them develop a self-driving ship. We use it to exchange data and collaborate. We do a lot of speeches at different conferences, Singapore, Dubai… we move to that places and get good contacts. We are very integrated to official state visits, we usually collaborate with ministry travels. We follow them to Smart-City conferences to kick start our development.","Our financial support comes from The European Commission and Horizon 2020 or different funds which support innovation. Otherwise our ministry of education and science, and Ministry of economical affairs as well as the Ministry of foreign affairs. We collaborate from technology transfer perspective with private business. If they have an idea and want someone to develop it, they ask us. And they always look for smart-people to work for them, even only to pitch their employees. They also give sponsorship to students. In TalTech, ten companies every year give sponsors to students in robotic. Skype’s biggest office is still located in our campus, on the next door to our lab. We collaborate punctually with NGO or civil society : for example on medical technology, the state road association has collaborate with us. Most state projects engage civil associations. Estonia is a small country and we are the only university focus on tech, so we are very connected to all intern networks.","There is a big change in urban spaces of the city : in front of the Hotel Viru, one of the most famous in town, the city plans to change the road design to make it a pedestrian area, with small traffic and commute. We are in a talk regarding the self-driving traffic areas. We would like to deploy our car first in secluded areas like airport, zoo, hospital… the whole idea is to broaden it once it becomes more safe.","The worst that happened in terms of innovation industry from the new government, is that they promised to invest more money into science but they didn’t. So people are quite disappointed by this mistrust. Apart from that, the concern is not really on tech industry, but more on the state side and how do ministries spend public money. The silver economy and Smart-City solutions have a lot to do together : so old people can talk through TV to family members and doctors. There are different solutions for the elevators and houses. The silver economy is a broad term but there are not so many kids coming these days in Europe, the age group of the elderly is growing and will become bigger in the future. We will need to find solutions to answer this need.",,"Getting people involved has been one of the key issues for the right-wing party actually in government (conservatives). They want people to decide as much as possible. All the rest of politics pray because we all know the average people can’t manage most state decisions. From a Smart-City perspective, we are on the other hand of Germany for example, where everything is very strict on privacy issues, where it is forbidden to send more that 20 emails at one time. Estonia is much more open to this automation facilities. We try to get rather inspired by the US. Global organizations are emerging and we try to find our way in it by participating and share the Estonian version of Smart-City.",,,,,

We changed our location for Estonia for different reasons. Personally I am Baha’ie (religion) and there is a lot of limitations in Iran to practice. I went to Estonia to study startup, mostly to get introduced to the legal context here and in European companies. I started my company on smart-logistic by trying to be close to the institutions. I wanted to move with my family but still waits the boarders to open again after pandemic. Two years ago, I applied for e-business residency, I didn’t needed a startup visa because I was already student, so received a student visa which is enough. There are usually a lot of problem around Iranian people because of the EU and the US sanctions. There are a lot of complication from banks and business areas. They fear Iranian somehow. I tried to open a bank account in Tallinn, but I couldn’t easily, only LHV accepted. It is not related to the public situation or the economy : there is no problem for Iranian to take a job or start a company, but the relationship with institutions is more complex, as well as money transfer from or to an Iranian bank.","My main goal now is to know the Estonian environment and culture better to start a new business here. I tried to do some interviews and studies about smart logistics, I get associated with another student, an Nigerian business man, and we have two other Nigerian in the team as developers, we are all students from the Estonian Entrepreneurship University. Before the corona we were starting some e-delivery, especially in smart city field around Estonian University of Applied Science. But the situation became very complicate : there is a lot of uncertainty. It is not only the remote work issue : the pandemic has raised a lot of barriers and economy problems. And especially in our field, the e-delivery, the competition have been very hard during this lock down measures seen has an historical opportunity, by also forbidden at some points because accused to participate the propagation of the virus. We are thinking about using robots, it is a complicate project and we will leave it for a better time.",,,"In my experience, there are some slowness in Estonian reaction, especially from the government side. They could do things more faster than they do now. for example to get my driver licence, it was needed that I bring a translation of the current one and they would issue a local one. It took me two month, it is very long. I didn’t expected this from an EU country.",,,,,,,"why did you chose Estonia and Europe rather than other markets like Asia or the US ?  Entering the EU market was an argument to move to Estonia. It is more easy to enter here than in other countries. The reason to move to Europe is because US or Canada is very far from Iran, trips are difficult and take a lot of time. Europe is near and of course it has an open market as US, but not that expensive that US economy. I think that Estonia is a good place to start a company because it is small and you can manage everything online, but unfortunately there are some barriers from Estonian people. The government of Estonia has old habits in between people, they could address this issues and deliver a better service to foreigner.",
2020-07-01,34,400,Tallinn,Interview,Man,Erik Ehasoo,Consultancy,https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikehasoo/,,SME,,"Innovation is close to my heart. I started from the startup side and built different companies and initiatives for the last 9 years. I started working for bigger companies as consultant, trying to help them bring this mindset as well. Currently I am engaged in different digital initiatives over energy mainly.","I wish to bridge these 2 worlds : corporate and startup. As an innovator, I focus on bridging political change to society. Startup have great mindset but limited resources. Corporate have a lot of resources but lack the capacity of innovation. By making a bridge, I target great society evolution. Nothing in particular, but a way to enhance people’s life. Tech is a tool, I work with it, in order to figure out how to enhance the society, to make life more meaningful.","I put quite a lot of efforts in digital community building by using tools on social media, on LinkedIn. I have been managing an innovators group on Facebook, and I write articles when I have time for it. If the digital side is quantity based, on physical word, I do more quality and prefer building a network one by one, focus on long-term relationship. As a consultant, I always chose longer term connection or mission to strengthen my relationship.","Yes it must be an effectiveness of small society of Estonia : it is easy to make connections. I work a lot with academics and researchers. They have a lot of activities in R&D and in developing Tech solutions. As for the public sector the Estonian e-residency program is like a startup itself. Over the years, they were a small team of consultants which I have worked with. You do not need to have a very high profile to catch them and work with them. Considering the civil society, not at the moment but I have been working in a NGO in my earlier career.","Lot of the political mindset could be improved. My personal experience is connected to quality of life, it could be much better with greener developments. Bike and pedestrian areas rather than car roads. If you build a city very enjoyable for the people, it also helps to attract the talents. Having this environment that brings talents is not like creating jobs. Even if you pay people a lot to live in cities with bad quality of life, you will struggle to attract them. If you have good schools, lifestyle, health… you will help the city to grow. I think that the key thing to do in Tallinn is increasing the quality of life.","I might be biased because I’m in, but honestly I haven’t seen so much. First Estonia grew in this startup society from the beginning. When they started in the 90's they had nothing. All logistics and infrastructures and the economy and the energy were turned from Est to West. They have had very hard times but the IT came to help the people. Estonians grew up knowing that digital solutions are part of the country, they never saw any other option of state. They had computers in school since they were kids in the 90's. Of course some people are perhaps not so well integrated, but this is a minority that become less and less important : from the digital side you always find ways to engage more and more people and you have to do it to improve the overall picture. We are now in a developed society and it becomes more complex to implement new stuff : in the 90's the people were ready to accept whatever. Now they have more comfort and moving out of this comfort is not always well accepted. But still people keep knowledge and trust in digital solutions. no one asks on the principle if tech is needed or not. this question do not exist here.",,"I don’t communicate mainstream myself : I am not a politician and I focus on my niche group which is not wider population. I published a digital book on Estonian digital infrastructure. My network of decision-makers, innovators is growing, and this book became quite popular. It has been a great way to make contacts.",,,,,

Tallinn is a good place for startups. Some years ago, the people were not much working in English but now the language gap is completely bound. The office culture is pretty different in between England and Estonia. How the people talk and interact : in UK they are more talkative. Estonia they tends to talk only if they have something to say. Offices are much quieter here and to be honest, I prefer that. In terms of pure business it is the same everywhere, language, issues, but there are less problem with bureaucracy in Estonia, you can do so much online.","I do have a team now, of 7 people, we built a marketing analytics platform. I was working on it for the last 6 months. We are for a very stable product to communicate and sell. “you only get 1 time for your 1st time”.",,"In my last job, I worked closely with Estonian government and universities on couple of joint projects. With civil society, we tries to but nothing huge, it is the same everywhere : sometimes non-profit do not trust business.","There are no tram network in the suburbs, so people have to drive. A performative public transportation everywhere could make a big difference. Apart of that, there are not so many things to improve. Tallinn is already a really great city. As for public services, the difference between England and Estonia is that England is probably 20 years behind. The way to interact with the state, receiving a licence, paying taxes, this is where you feel the difference. In Spain, interacting with the government is even worst, it can be a nightmare. They do nothing better than before internet was invented. Tallinn is good for transport card for all bus, tram, etc. pretty easy to use e-scooters too, to bridge the gaps in transport. If you are resident you have all transport free, it makes you feel that states cares about you. this one app to park your car, with no cash, from your phone is very good too. interactions with the city are online, if you have to apply for a permit, it takes a few minutes. everything is very simple and makes a real difference.","The government have definitely moved to the right already in the last election, and it creates come issues for tech companies. They made a lots of noise about how they would like to limit the non-EU workers. They finally didn’t did nothing big in that direction, but communicate and made noise. It could really affect the local tech industry which hires a lot of people from Ukraine, South Asia, etc. It could force them to develop their companies differently, outside of Estonia.",,,,"Estonian don’t care about politics at all. and so the few far-right parties have been elected, and this is how they realized it. In terms of city planning, I am not sure if there are top-down or bottom-up projects. A new shopping mall has been built with Chinese money, there was not the need for it nor any demand from the inhabitants, but someone paid for it so they built it. A pity because, some different kind of projects like traffic lights would make much more sense for the inhabitants : the traffic is always busy for people. But money has been put into a new mall which will probably go bankrupt in despite of clients and the city will have to find a way to deal with an empty shopping mall, even if they didn’t paid for it.",,Estonian e-residency has been presented as a way for UK citizens to keep doing business easily with EU. what is your experience ? I am a resident of Estonia because I have spent many year here. A lot of people from UK were already residents in Tallinn. I have seen many articles talking about that and I can see the marketing benefit but I haven’t see the breakdown. It is said that 300 millions of revenue is created by e-residency but I am suspicious before seeing data.,
2020-07-02,36,402,Tallinn,Interview,Man,Markko Karu,Consultancy,https://www.linkedin.com/in/markkokaru/,,SME,,"I started industrial design, graduate and went to work in advertising around 2000. I am fascinated by strategic design. I co-founded a design studio. 5 years later, other partners found a branding design agency. I have been looking at different fields of design. In 2012, I went to study design and development of culture environment, especially from a startup perspective. I applied to garage 48 in 2012 and win this hackathon with Qminder. I did my studies and my startup growth at the same time. Once graduate I left the company and get involved in several startups. I also did freelance consulting at the same time. Becoming freelance was a way to become product owner. I joined a team at a strategic position which was more interesting for me. Later I joined in 2017 the team of FounderBeam, an investing and trading app. I aimed to make it more user friendly and usable. I found the legal agreements between the company and investors, since I didn’t had any legal background, I left it in 2019 and started freelancing again, helping different companies. I have been around the design industry for about 25 years, my passion is systems and how products work. but I have been doing a lot of graphic work and visual design as well.","My whole history makes sense, I make decisions on the moment on passion, and then this decisions start to combine into a pattern. I have been interested in how the things work, not interested in routine. I am usually the one who comes with an initial idea but never finish it. This has been my role in many teams. It is harder for me to stay focus or energized once the team has no issues to solve, once the company or the product becomes stable, I lose my interest and look for something more challenging. I am now freelancing again because I feel that I can be more useful that way for a period of time : I realized that I do not have personal intern question to answer, so I always try to solve someone else problem.","I am quite well connected because of different events. The first one I attended was organized by the British council in 2004, it was called “raising stars”. In 2007 I took the challenge for “designer of the year” and did a lot of networking in that time. In Estonia, by being active in startups and founders club, I can easily meet a lot of people, and the country is small enough for not having the need to become more famous. I also did some videos for the music industry, I wrote articles, I gave lectures or organized workshops, public events, I am quite well know in the circles now. The biggest thanks goes to the British Council which introduced me to public talking.","It is mostly about lectures, I helped many municipalities to organize design competitions or come with new policies. I do not do Pro Bono work because most organizations who need it can’t achieve the work behind. When I engage in NGO or non-profit, I usually sets the limits, because when you start to help, there are always a lot and a lot to do. So you can’t make bread if the ingredients are not there. In the design sector he haven’t been active lately, because it is a close community. There is no real benefit, there is no new information: when you want to sell you paintings, you have to talk to customers, not your peers. I didn’t found no professional relationship to network with in this field. In a startup community it makes much more sense to be active : it is a mix of skills, you need the ones of others and they need yours, so it is a constant exchange and learning with peers.","10 years ago, the city was corrupted and really few politicians benefit from businessmen to pay for them. The guy was trialed. The openness in the last 5 years have changed but some remains of this system. The biggest problem is central planning : the decisions are made, discussed under the influence of this corrupted mindset. As a result, the citizens do not understand why decisions are made. My biggest concern is that I am an active cyclist and I promote biking in Tallinn for the last 10 years. I go working by bike even in the winter. A group a people have been doing research on where the bikes lines could be in the city. The official city planner came by and said there was no need for change because no bike enough in the city. He closed the discussion and all those people have been working for nothing. In my experience, the harder part is to convince the politics that it is useful and needed to change habits. But to prove them you have to impulse the change and since they do not follow, the change never comes by. It is a circular problem. Whatever you do as a plan, you have to take the forces at consideration. You can’t force the people to do what you want. you have to work with them. For alcohol, it has been complicate in Estonia at certain time, so anyone was buying it in Latvia and the Estonian state have lost money.","Yes, people can be skeptical about startups because they see a lot of fails but do not look at the long term benefits. There is a gap in between the 10 years strategy value and the need to bring the money in short term. There is a lot of hype around the ego bursting too. Personal storytelling and rising money from investors became an end goal of this startup movement and this is a part of the combination that create a reject from a part of the population. Like the connections between automation and foreign workers. There are completely two different topics, but the population see it as one because they lose their job. So the global rise of populism is that people want to go back at a time when they had jobs. It is a natural behavior, that when you experience something hard, you want to go back to the last state of security, but the world has moved on, and they have benefit of it : google map, video-calls, and all those free tools very convenient.","Blockchain, AI, there is a gap between the people who talk about it and the ones who use it. Smart-City is similar. On the one hand I understand how you can plan differently when you are a dictator : you can have sensors everywhere, and put automation driven by the data. How you change the way the people are living is quite academic problematic. When you include everybody in a discussion, most of the population want to delegate to an expert which will make a proposition and take the responsibility. And the more the people are concerned about a topic, the more they call for a specialist to take the decision for them.",,,,,"How would you define the best skills of Estonians ? We use to say “Estonian sellers are aggressively waiting for customers to call” it means that we are not good at sales. It is indeed not very natural to approach someone we do not know here. What is good about Estonians is that they can be trusted. Once they commit, something they deliver it. They don’t over-sell the product so everything that is said can be taken as a fair value. When you give an appointment, Estonians are at time. 13.00 means 13.00 and if the meeting didn’t started after 15 min, it means it is cancelled. I remember that we went for some cooperation in Italy once, and the contact gave us a meeting “in the morning” without giving a precise hour. I remember that we were very confused and stressed by this absence of rule.",
2020-07-02,37,403,Tallinn,Interview,Man,Farokh Shahabi Nezhad,CEO,https://www.linkedin.com/in/farokhshahabi/,,Startup,,"My main expertise is data analytics and data driven business solutions. I just create a customer data platform for small commerce. I started in 2018 in Iran, then in 2019 I wanted to go global and have an international presence. So we move on the European market and started to have customers in Germany, UK and the Baltic. I had a previous experience in UK and with different European countries, so I knew there are many options here. I chose Estonia because it is very tech, and I want a very active ecosystem to grow. I have received my residence permit.",With my previous company we provided data mining solutions for big enterprises. They had money and power to execute and we benefit it. But I felt at a point that SMEs do not have enough money to spend on data mining and analysis. So we create this company to deliver these services to SMEs with no knowledge in intern. We offer marketing automation solutions very easy to understand and use. It helps small businesses to compete with bigger companies.,"The best thing that took of and made us popular has been to create a form to get more subscriptions. We always add free tools as a hook for our services. We went viral, everyone was using it and it is getting better and better. We haven’t been in hackathons, it is not our first startup, we already had the knowledge to build it and the first supports. We also had other revenue streams to begin. Now we are engaged in a foundraising process : last past year we raised 65.000 euros and now look for 300.000 euros.","We work closely with academics from everywhere, Iran as well. In the corona situation, schools and universities create online exams and classes, it has been a great opportunity : now we have 50.000 students and 300 institutions on our platform. As for the civil society, some NGOs use us, and some non-profit like TEDx events. 100 events use us for registration, payment, managing attendees. and popular NGOs from universities for job application, registration, audience management. They have special discount for NGOs and non-profit to use as free or almost free services. The public sector we do not really have connections, except some in Iran. I am more focus on working with private sector.","The best thing we want is to grow very fast into the European market and we want the Baltic to be a jump base for us. We all work remote but we want to make it a very global company. We want to make a big remote and successful global company from Estonia. I believe that no one should help a startup except the startup itself. I am not in favor of public engagement in the business side. We have to be active, meet people, work with them, participate events. I do not demand or want something from public sector except ease the regulations, and Estonia already has done a lot. Having a very fast service is the most important, we look for stability to grow. When rules change too often so you can’t grow.","I haven’t been confronted to that. We were working before and we didn’t encounter any think like this. It’s the future and people knows it. why would people want to continue slow and complicate procedures when we can ease it ? The digitalization movement moves forward by the way and finally it becomes the best option to cut cost and be more effective. There are some countries moving faster and others slower, this is a reality. China had huge job to do on the last 10 years and it becomes better every day.","When internet and smartphone have been invented, it was the same. First people thought it was an academic tool and they did not need it. Then these innovations came into there life and now they use it everyday. The public do not really care about the tech itself, they care about the result. When they see the result, they will understand how they can benefit it, they do not need to understand the protocol and how it works. they use it because it makes the job. They don’t care and don’t really want to know what’s inside the box. The best thing that happen to any technology is to show the results to attract more users. Nowadays data mining and data analytics can solve a lot of problems. A lot of inefficiency can be fixed in all industries and in the public sector by improving it on data mining. The industry collects the data, they have it, but do not use it because they do not know how to do. We have a lot of inefficiency in the world, and we can solved it if we change the status quo, if we change how we work. For that we need analytics and mining.",,,,,,
2020-07-02,38,404,Tallinn,Interview,Woman,Anni Saar,Head of Legal Operations,https://www.linkedin.com/in/anni-saar/,Startup Wise Guys,Startup Incubator,,"I studied 9 years ago, have been living in Argentina and came to Tallinn Technical University for legal studies on IT law, both for Estonian public and private law. I started to work on Estonian Human Right Center as legal expert for 6 years, and gave lectures in TalTech during 5 years in IT law, contract law. I have both professional experience in startup, and in a law firm, and I really prefer the startup mindset. When I saw an offer of Startup Wize Guys in law I joined them. Start Wise Guys started in 2012, as part of the Estonian Mafia. And they have their own mafia too : we have hosted 200 startup in FinTech, Saas,… We will open a new office in Italy, and we have projects in Turkey, Ukraine, we try to be the most active as possible. We write a report on Baltic ecosystem. Basically we propose a 3,5 month accelerator. Our startups receive training, meetings, mentors, marketing week, sales… all what they need to grow and develop. It is very founders oriented.","Obviously it is to grow the most, to be the best, those two can’t be taken separately. But we want to be coherent with our values and keep the good ambient. We take care about our team and we do not want a corporate mindset but to scale by respecting who we are. We organize events, in Latvia, in Turkey, and everybody of our team are very excited to participate and tell their success story. We all want to show what happened, how everybody supports each other, how we get together and how everybody feels that he can trust each other. We want to keep the feeling this way. Our CEO is Spanish by the way, he studied here and stayed to create the company.","Apart of organizing events as I just said, we also have online pre-accelerators. It is a step before they come inside, it is for free, no money to be paid. The startup who gets selected can reach prices to join the accelerator. this is what we do for the community. We feel that we have done something for the better cause. We also have different partnerships and events (ex. Tech Chill Lithuania) where we provide pitches, jury members, reports on the ecosystem. We have a joint partnership this year we will have a summer school from 16 to 22 years old. We also offer co-working opportunities to startups who want to be close to us. The investors are also very active : they come to mentor, give feedback before the final pitches. We also have a lot of partners from banks, and local and international mentors from EU, US…","As for the public sector we contribute to the cyber vertical with the Ministry of Defense, Startup Estonia is also a partner. We are not only in private business or academics, we are close to the public sector and education area. There are not many NGOs in Estonia. Even if I was working in human right center I do not see n how to collaborate with them. In the sustainability vertical, it will probably be feasible. Through mentoring, we also have some non-profit organisations that give talks in the health and mental health part.","Most of startups are established in Estonia, because it is much more easy to manage. The program we run in Lithuania is 50/50% private/public (from EU), in Estonia the funds are 100% private. So it changes a bit the way to grow the startups : the ones from Lithuania have to be established in Lithuania. In Estonia there are no restriction on the place to establish the startup, with an e-resident card or not. The new law will ease the share selling even if it is not really difficult at this moment. Maybe a system to ease the apartment research in Tallinn could help. Apart from that, there are not so many things to improve from Tallinn city: sport, nightlife, spas, rent a car… all what is good for startups is already available.","Startups are different than regular companies, and sometimes the politics, even the ministry of IT, do not want to understand it. I am 100% inside startups but my friends and family are not and they have nothing against. It is also said that it is complex for Russians to integrate, but I do not feel it : we all go to Estonian school together. So I do not see that this issue do not exist, but I can’t see it myself. Of course, some people have comfort and they do not want to change their habits, so startup somehow can disturb them. But Estonians are rather proud of their startups and startup community.",,"We publish report and communication in TV, articles have been written. We go time to time to schools to provide lectures or present ourselves. All of us take the opportunity when there is to go and talk somewhere, share our experience, advice on the opportunities and risks. Our team is not only Estonian, it comes from all over Europe. We volunteer at some events, we talk to the TV, do live streams, interviews… We try to do our best to raise the openness and the knowledge around the projects we work on. The youngest startup founder in our program was about 18 years old.",,,,,
2020-07-02,39,405,Tallinn,Interview,Woman,Siiri Kolka,Director,https://www.linkedin.com/in/siiri-kolka-846586173/,Euraxess Estonia,Public Service,,"I represent mostly the European Commission Initative called EURAXESS, which was create to support researchers mobility in between European countries. I use it here to attract talents in Estonia. Initially it was mostly to provide a support for geographical mobility and at a legal level : some work had to be done in terms of making the legislation more friendly to make people work more easily in Estonian research. Before the Ministry of Education and Science, there was a lot of collaboration with the Ministry of Interior, to make inclusion term for specific immigrants. We have eased the exception for researchers, and it helped the startups to grow upon, and drive similar negotiations. From visa process, to find a kindergarten, all must be smooth for researchers in order to move in Estonia, and finally it eased the startups too. When I left my main attaches group in 2016, in European Commission level, a lot of push had been done to support researchers career, which also means more and more emphasize to mobility between sectors and train researchers in entrepreneurial skills. Our main research institution with all this startup activities in Estonia, have quite good networking experience, but nevertheless, Euraxess services are a very big part of this service at an international level. We gather 14 countries at their ministries level, we collect the information, and share it to the right spaces.","At this moment, for this initiative, we can only make sure that our efforts are being done. If there are researchers from the Estonian Research Institutes that would be interested in a startup community, so we will help them find it. The career development support for researchers in general is out goal. This community in itself, and also Enterprise Estonia in certain cases for this purpose, have more resources. Since we spend public money, we need to be sure that we achieve our goals. Actually we try to establish an e-toolbox to educate the Euraxess network to become more aware of the Startup movement, to help better the researchers to move in. In Estonia, this system works well, it is already good by itself and do not need so much support, but when you go to small research institutes, they will need more help to understand. In Estonia, startup has to be tech and scalable, but it is not the case in all countries. So we also look at how to do research-based startups meaning not IT, but academic-research based startup/entrepreneurship.",,"Estonian research is a foundation related to the ministry of education. European network is slowly moving towards providing information about the possible shift from Academic results to startup. And that kind of consultation of information services is slow and a matter of public founding. If you would open any public announcement then you would see that everybody is emphasizing the need to support on that side. states are trying to do, trying to support, both national and European level.",,,,,,,,,
2020-07-05,40,406,Tallinn,Interview,Woman,Anu Oks,Director,https://www.linkedin.com/in/anu-oks-91b836112/,Estonian Business Angel Network,Founding Partner,,"I am not the founder of EstBAN myself, but since I started working in startups and building programs I have been selected to manage this network. I started my career in Enterprise Estonia, which provides grants and services. I was working on public grants there. Then I was building startup programs for TalTech, she took very responsible assignments to build angel network in Estonia. Now I am working for 3 years with EstBAN and improving the angel investing in Estonia. We have a very strong and agile ecosystem, even if small. EstBAN is now 6 or 7 year old. We were established in 2013 as an NGO by 25 young very active super angels in Estonia. We have been growing to 150 investors. The main value is the network itself. We do not invest directly, we provide services. EstBAN investor is mainly Estonia and around 43 years old. We also have international neighbors which look for investing opportunities in Estonia and the Baltic. We do not have only Estonian startup but also from Nordic, Baltic, Russia, Ukraine. BANs are a few all over Europe, and there is a rooftop organisation. EstBAN is a member of euBAN.","Basicaly, EstBan main goals are to provide the better ecosystem for angel investing and startups, the better opportunities to get seed founding for startups and the best startups to invest their assets in. A better angel investment scene for both parties. Rising the knowledge of angel investing for all society for anyone to understand what are Angel Investors and how to reach them. Showing Europe and the world what Estonia is doing in terms of angel investment.","We do documents and templates for investing, some lobbying fto government and involve the public servants as well. Our main activities are to do with the deal flow: pitching events for startups to present to investors. Lot of networking aspects in these events. They are very unformal : training sessions for new investors, understand what is round ABC, mistakes not to make and activities to do. We are always taking part in different flashing events. We are putting together syndicates of investment with small investors, for small tickets to be able to invest together, combined by the business angel support. This is usually done in corporation. We have contacts with other networks : US, Denmark, Iceland, Israel, to understand how it works in other ecosystems and to introduce ourselves. We do study trips, training, dedicated angel investors events like festival Angel Camp, with max 100 participants, very focus. The importance of cooperation with other investor networks like fiBAN, is knowledge exchanges, the lobbying and educating the society, we make articles, we present ourselves at the radio, TV shows to talk about Angel investment in startups. this is done by 2 staff members (CEO and the marketing)","We work very close with incubators and accelerators. We are doing cooperation with universities, teaching and training students and providing mentoring in university programs. Startup Estonia has also a public sector network which works very close with EstBAN and we also work with corporate companies which are interested in innovation and financing startups (energy companies, bank companies…) the cooperation model is with all categories of stakeholders.","We haven’t done any cooperation with the City of Tallinn so far, because we haven’t seen any cooperation opportunity to work together. The city of Tallinn is supporting the earlier stage startups with programs and incubators and co-working places, but I haven’t found any topic or activity to cooperate with them.",,,,,,,Do you have anything related in Smart-City and Urban Innovation?  We have quite many startups which have been pitching their projects to EstBAN especially green energy and smart environment. We work together with VC founds which are looking for this field. They usually do not look for early stages but then invest more into society and city scale solutions. The quick value back in Smart City is usually what we get interested in that field. Recently we received a smart-parking system. Technopol is quite engaged in the urban innovation aspect.,
