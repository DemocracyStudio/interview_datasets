# interview_datasets
This repository hosts the one-to-one interviews of key stakeholders collected in Taipei, 
Tel Aviv and Tallinn, three cities which are the three case studies of my PhD research on 
Stakeholder Engagement in Smart-City. It has been collected by in-person meetings or through video calls.
I aim to use these files to make some semantic analysis, word clustering, by using text mining tools. 
I am sharing these datasets in order to offer some possibilities of collaboration around my research. 
You can read more explanation on the underlying internet-based research methodology I'm using here :
